We’ll talk later.

1538437505124
2686
I’ll be right back.

1538437507809
1852
You got a verdict, Sidney?

1538437509694
2186
My guess is something
terrible happened to him

1538437511930
3320
out in the field,
and he decided to deal with it

1538437515283
1568
by not dealing with it.

1538437516885
1185
What can we do?

1538437518103
2936
I’d like to hypnotize him--
hopefully dig up

1538437521073
2252
whatever he so desperately
wants to forget.

1538437523325
1668
Can you do it here?

1538437525043
1502
Right under the big top.

1538437526578
1952
I’ll need a couple
of volunteers.

1538437528563
1285
Me. Me.
Take me.

1538437529881
1218
Okay, Hawkeye

with the hairy lip.

1538437533652
1852
Margaret, try
to keep him calm.
Sure.

1538437535503
2436
I guess all I get to do
is wish you luck.

1538437537990
2519
We could use some of that.
So what do we do?

1538437540542
2553
Either of you ever
act in a school play?

1538437543145
2870
In college, I
played Hamlet.
No kidding?

1538437546048
2953
I was pre-med. I was
the only one who could
get his hands on a skull.

1538437549034
2569
I’m gonna try to have Nielson
relive his trauma

1538437551637
2186
under hypnosis,
bring him back to the time

1538437553872
2703
and place where he lost
his memory.

1538437556608
834
How do we fit in?

1538437557476
1385
I’ll tell you over a beer.

1538437558894
1952
You’re going to help re-create
that time and place.

1538437560879
1852
You’ll be everything
from the voices of his buddies

1538437562781

Wait a minute.

2352
Sounds of the battle?
You got to be kidding.

1538437567603
2402
I’ve done this before.
I’ve seen it work.

loses one little job

1538437615134

on everybody.

1251
What makes him think

1538437619054
1802
they’d have taken him
in the first place?

1538437620889
2536
If there was a janitor’s job
opening he might have
stood a chance.

1538437623458

Before you and your

to another treatment, ask if
XELJANZ XR is right for you.

1538437757141
2753
XELJANZ XR is a
once-daily pill for adults

1538437759894
2803
with moderate to severe
RA for whom methotrexate

1538437762698
1001
did not work well enough.

1538437763865
3036
It can reduce pain, swelling
and further joint damage,

1538437766902
1502
even without methotrexate.

1538437768403

XELJANZ XR can lower your

2536
Serious, sometimes fatal
infections, lymphoma and

1418

1538437785504

Your doctor should
perform blood tests

1538437787255
2503
before you start and
while taking XELJANZ XR,

1538437789758
2002
and monitor
certain liver tests.

1538437791760
1585
Tell your doctor if
you were in a region

1538437793345
1552
where fungal
infections are common

1538437794896
2286
and if you have had
TB, hepatitis B or C,

1538437797182
1585
or are prone to infections.

1538437798767
2169
Don’t let another

(AVO) Another TRU story with
KEYTRUDA.

1538438056137
2002
(Roger) My doctor said I
could start on KEYTRUDA

1538438058172
934
so I did.

1538438059140
2870
With each scan things
just got better.

1538438062043
2669
(AVO) In a clinical study,
KEYTRUDA offered patients

1538438064746
1335
a longer life than chemotherapy.

1538438066114
1835
And it could be your first
treatment.

1538438067982
2402
KEYTRUDA is for adults with
non-small cell lung cancer

1538438070418
968
that has spread...

1538438071419
1535
...who test positive for
PD-L1

1538438072987
3437
and whose tumors do not have an
abnormal ""EGFR"" or ""ALK"" gene.

1538438076457
3270
It’s the immunotherapy with the
most FDA-approved uses for

1538438079761
1902
advanced lung cancer.

1538438081696
1802
KEYTRUDA can cause your immune
system to

1538438083531
2102
attack normal organs and
tissues in your body

1538438085666
2069
and affect how they work. This
can happen anytime

1538438087768
3003
during or after treatment and
may be severe and lead to death.

1538438090805
2102
See your doctor right away if
you experience new or

1538438092940
2436
worsening cough, chest pain,
shortness of breath,

1538438095409
3337
diarrhea, severe stomach pain or
tenderness, nausea or vomiting,

1538438098779
1535
rapid heartbeat, constipation,

1538438100348
2102
changes in urine, changes in
eyesight,

1538438102483
1034
muscle pain or weakness,

1538438103551
2169
joint pain, confusion or memory
problems,

1538438105753
2069
fever, rash, itching or
flushing,

1538438107855
3170
as this may keep these problems
from becoming more serious.

1538438111058
2135
These are not all the possible
side effects of KEYTRUDA.

1538438113227
2503
Tell your doctor about all your
medical conditions

1538438115763
2069
including immune system
problems, or if you’ve had

1538438117865
3837
an organ transplant or lung,
breathing, or liver problems.

1538438121735
2769
(Roger ) Before I’d think of
the stuff I might miss.

1538438124539
1935
But now with
KEYTRUDA, we have hope.

1538438126508
2202
(AVO) Living longer is possible.

1538438128743
1001
It’s TRU.

1538438129778
1268
KEYTRUDA, from Merck.

1538438131146
1969
Ask your doctor about KEYTRUDA.

1538438150097
3170
What if numbers tell only
half the story?

1538438153300
3203
At T. Rowe Price, hundreds of
our experts go beyond the

1538438156571
4171
numbers to examine investment
opportunities firsthand.

1538438160775
2002
Like a biotech firm
that engineers

1538438162811
3504
a patient’s own cells
to fight cancer.

1538438166347

This is Strategic Investing.

deserve the full story.

1538438178559

A once-in-five hundred
year storm

1538438180361
2069
should happen every
five hundred years, right?

1538438182863
3170
Fact is, there have been
twenty-six in the last decade.

1538438186300
934
Allstate is adapting.

1538438187335
2469
With drones to assess
home damage sooner.

1538438190304
1835
And if a flying object
damages your car,

1538438192506
3637
you can snap a photo and get
your claim processed in hours,

1538438196244
1001
not days.

1538438198346
2236
Plus, Allstate can pay
your claim in minutes.

1538438202049
1335
Now that you know the truth...

1538438206621
1335
are you in Good Hands?

when other medications haven’t

TAKING TRULICITY WITH A

COMMON SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE

This is amazing.

1538438195141
1869
With moderate to severe
ulcerative colitis,

1538438197043
1068
Are you okay?

1538438198144
3437
even when I was there,

1538438201614
1502
I never knew when my symptoms

1538438203149
3804
would keep us apart.

1538438206986
2135
So I talked to my doctor
about HUMIRA.

1538438209155
1368
I learned HUMIRA can help get,

1538438210556
1568
and keep UC under control

1538438212158
2369
when other medications haven’t
worked well enough.

1538438214560
2236
And it helps people achieve
control that lasts.

1538438216829
1201
So you can experience few

1538438218064
1168
or no symptoms.

1538438219265
2102
HUMIRA can lower your ability
to fight infections,

1538438221401
1268
including tuberculosis.

1538438222702
2135
Serious, sometimes fatal
infections and cancers,

1538438224871
1702
including lymphoma, have
happened;

1538438226606
2336
as have blood, liver, and
nervous system problems,

1538438228974
3003
serious allergic reactions, and
new or worsening heart failure.

1538438232011
2035
Before treatment,
get tested for TB.

1538438234080
1602
Tell your doctor if you’ve been
to areas

1538438235714
1802
where certain fungal infections
are common,

1538438237550
1101
and if you’ve had TB,

1538438238685
868
hepatitis B,

1538438239585
1168
are prone to infections,

1538438240787
1735
or have flu-like symptoms
or sores.

1538438242555
2236
Don’t start HUMIRA if you have
an infection.

1538438244824
1768
Be there for you, and them.

1538438246626
2503
Ask your gastroenterologist
about HUMIRA.

1538438249161
2102
With HUMIRA,
control is possible.

1538438252665

Do I use a toothpaste that
whitens my teeth,

1538438253599
1635
or one that‘s good for my teeth?

You can drink, eat well and
exercise.

1538437518716

But to look completely healthy,
you need healthy skin.

1538437521620
2836
Cetaphil is clinically shown to
strengthen the skin’s barrier

1538437524489
2703
and protect even the most
senstive skin against dryness.

1538437527225
1535
So you can look healthier.

1538437528793

Complete your healthy routine
with Cetaphil.

Managing my type 2 diabetes
wasn’t my top priority.

1538437534732
1435
Until I held her.

1538437536201
1702
I found my Tresiba® Reason.

1538437537936
2236
Now I’m doing more
to lower my A1C.

1538437540205
3303
Once daily Tresiba® controls
blood sugar for 24 hours

1538437543541
1835
for powerful A1C reduction.

1538437545410
1568
Tresiba® is
a long-acting insulin

1538437547012
2703
used to control high blood sugar
in adults with diabetes.

1538437549748
2503
Don’t use Tresiba® to treat
diabetic ketoacidosis,

1538437552283
1368
during episodes of
low blood sugar,

1538437553685
2302
or if you are allergic to
any of its ingredients.

1538437556021
1535
Don’t share needles
or insulin pens.

1538437557589
1301
Don’t reuse needles.

1538437558923
1401
The most common side effect
is low blood sugar,

1538437560358
1602
which may cause
dizziness, sweating,

1538437561993
1435
confusion, and headache.

1538437563461
1068
Check your blood sugar.

1538437564562
1101
Low blood sugar can be serious

1538437565696
1068
and may be life-threatening.

1538437566798
1502
Injection site reactions
may occur.

1538437568332
1768
Tell your prescriber about
all medicines you take

1538437570134
1235
and all your medical conditions.

1538437571402
1768
Taking TZDs with insulins
like Tresiba®

1538437573205
2069
may cause serious side effects
like heart failure.

1538437575307
1168
Your insulin dose
shouldn’t be changed

1538437576508
1401
without asking your prescriber.

1538437577943
1935
Get medical help right away
if you have trouble breathing,

1538437579911
1835
fast heartbeat,
extreme drowsiness,

1538437581780
1635
swelling of your face,
tongue or throat,

1538437583447
1368
dizziness or confusion.

1538437584849
2002
I found my
Tresiba® Reason.

1538437586884
1201
Find yours.

1538437588119
1268
Ask your health care provider

1538437589420
1902
about Tresiba®.

1538437591322
2669
I believe that healthcare
should be a right,

1538437593992
1068
not a privilege.

1538437595060
2836
In the state of Florida
everyday working people,

1538437597896
2636
middle-class people,
should not be one

1538437600532
1735
illness away from bankruptcy.

1538437602767
1568
My name is Andrew Gillum,

1538437604335
1201
and as governor,

1538437605536
3704
I’ll expand Medicaid for over
800,000 working people.

1538437609774
2636
Protect Floridians with
pre-existing conditions.

1538437613077
2870
And protect Medicare for
all of our seniors.

1538437616347

Together we can make healthcare
affordable for all.

1538437517759

Anyway, back on the farm,
I contacted the spirit
of my first pet pig, Snorty.

1538437522064
2135
And what did your
dead pig tell you?

1538437524233
3637
That’s a sentence I never
thought I’d say.

1538437527903
3170
Turns out he was pretty peeved
about ending up as a BLT!

1538437531106
3770
The point is, if I can
contact Snorty, then maybe
he can contact Olga.

1538437534910
2236
But what if Olga
doesn’t speak oink?

1538437537179
3770
And that’s something
I never thought I’d say.

steamed about gettin’ smoked.

is that she never got
the chance to marry Roland!

Wait, so Jorge
was just sleepwalking?

1538438259300
2002
This explains where
all our blankets went.

1538438261335
2870
And why there were candy
wrappers in the mess hall.

1538438264238
2736
And this jam must be
the blood on the canoe.

1538438269210
1835
This blood needs
a little peanut butter.

1538438272146
2936
So the ghost was Jorge?

1538438275116
3103
It must have been him
in the camera footage,
wrapped in a blanket.

1538438278252
3036
And the whistle must have been
from Jorge’s deviated septum.

1538438281322
2703
Sometimes he makes
that noise in his sleep.

1538438284058

to tell us this before?

What am I doing
in the tool shed?

1538438298205
1969
(GASPS) Did the ghost
bring me here?

1538438300207
2769
Did she turn my legs
into taquitos?

1538438303010
2169
No, Jorge, you are fine.

1538438305212
3136
And you are also the ghost.

1538438308382
2703
Everything that happened
was just you sleepwalking.

1538438311118
3103
Oh, that makes sense.

1538438314255
2836
That Olga ghost story
really scared me,

1538438317124
2035
and I sleepwalk
when I’m scared.

1538438319193
3036
But why were you also
sleep-stealing our
blankets and candy?

1538438322263
2669
Obviously, after hearing
the ghost story,

1538438324965
2302
he was stealing things
that Olga would have wanted.

1538438327301
2102
She was cold and loved candy.

1538438329437
3837
I feel I should point out,
Jorge also steals candy
when he’s awake.

1538438336110
2069
I can’t believe I wore this
hideous dress for nothing.

1538438338212

Hmph, not for nothing.
You look ridiculous! (LAUGHS)

1538438342383

Actually, she looks gorgeous.

1538438344319
968
I know. (STOMPS FOOT)

1538438347455
2669
By the way, Emma,
if I die first,

1538438350158
2002
I’m gonna haunt
the heck out of you!

1538438352193
3770
Just think, in 100 years,
some poor campers will be
throwing Hazel a wedding.

1538438360367
2803
There’s just one thing
I still don’t get.

1538438363204
4838
Jorge, why did you write
the word ""angry"" in jam
on the canoe in the mess hall?

1538438368075
4271
I didn’t. I must’ve written
""hungry."" But my ""H’s""
kind of look like ""A’s.""

1538438372379
1969
But you still forgot the
letter ""u"" in ""hungry.""

1538438374381
2536
I’m also a really bad speller.

1538438376951
4104
Plus, I was asleep,
and writing in jam.
Get off my back!

1538438382423

1538438386194

You can drink, eat well and

1538437592398

But to look completely healthy,
you need healthy skin.

1538437595301
2803
Cetaphil is clinically shown to
strengthen the skin’s barrier

1538437598171
2636
and protect even the most
senstive skin against dryness.

1538437600874
1535
So you can look healthier.

Complete your healthy routine
with Cetaphil.

Managing my type 2 diabetes
wasn’t my top priority.

1538437608314
1401
Until I held her.

1538437609783
1668
I found my Tresiba® Reason.

1538437611518
2202
Now I’m doing more
to lower my A1C.

1538437613787
3270
Once daily Tresiba® controls
blood sugar for 24 hours

1538437617123
1802
for powerful A1C reduction.

1538437618992
1535
Tresiba® is
a long-acting insulin

1538437620593
2669
used to control high blood sugar
in adults with diabetes.

1538437623329
2469
Don’t use Tresiba® to treat
diabetic ketoacidosis,

1538437625865
1335
during episodes of
low blood sugar,

1538437627266
2269
or if you are allergic to
any of its ingredients.

1538437629602
1502
Don’t share needles
or insulin pens.

1538437631170
1268
Don’t reuse needles.

1538437632505
1368
The most common side effect
is low blood sugar,

1538437633940
1568
which may cause
dizziness, sweating,

1538437635574
1401
confusion, and headache.

1538437637043
1034
Check your blood sugar.

1538437638144
1068
Low blood sugar can be serious

1538437639278
1034
and may be life-threatening.

1538437640379
1468
Injection site reactions
may occur.

1538437641914
1735
Tell your prescriber about
all medicines you take

1538437643716
1201
and all your medical conditions.

1538437644984
1735
Taking TZDs with insulins
like Tresiba®

1538437646786
2035
may cause serious side effects
like heart failure.

1538437648888
1134
Your insulin dose
shouldn’t be changed

1538437650090
1435
without asking your prescriber.

1538437651591
1835
Get medical help right away
if you have trouble breathing,

1538437653493
1802
fast heartbeat,
extreme drowsiness,

1538437655361

dizziness or confusion.

1538437658432

1538437664330
934
TREMFYA® is for adults with

1538437665297
1535
moderate to severe
plaque psoriasis.

1538437666999
2169
With TREMFYA®,
you can get clearer.

1538437669201
1201
And stay clearer.

1538437670435
3403
In fact, most patients who saw
90% clearer skin at 28 weeks

1538437673872
2069
stayed clearer through 48 weeks.

1538437675974

TREMFYA® works better than

1538437677309
1068
Humira® at providing

1538437678410
1435
clearer skin, and more patients

1538437679878
1602
were symptom free with TREMFYA®.

1538437681513
2202
TREMFYA® may lower your
ability to fight infections

1538437683748
1802
and may increase your
risk of infections.

1538437685717
1835
Before treatment, your
doctor should check you

1538437687586
1568
for infections and tuberculosis.

1538437689254
1535
Tell your doctor if
you have an infection

1538437690822
1101
or have symptoms such as:

1538437691957
2269
fever, sweats, chills,
muscle aches or cough.

1538437694392
2069
Before starting TREMFYA®
tell your doctor

1538437696495
2069
if you plan to or have
recently received a vaccine.

1538437698730
1935
Ask your doctor about TREMFYA®.

1538437700699

deserve to stay clearer.

that it was out of control.

1538437505562
2169
You said things
that were out of line,

1538437507731
2436
I reacted and said things
that were out of line,

1538437510167
1435
and then I think Shane was

1538437511602
1401
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

1538437513003
1535
- Can I explain to you
real quick?

1538437514538
1368
Can I just explain to you...
- Sure.

1538437515906
1368
- Like, what ha--okay.
- Okay.

1538437517274
1802
- So Shane started--
- Mm-hmm.

1538437519076
2369
- He just started,
like, butting in,

1538437521445
3237
and it wasn’t, like, his place
or to butt in--[stammers]

1538437524681
1935
It sounded like he was
sticking up for Steve,

1538437526617
1735
and I didn’t like it.

1538437528352
3003
And then he said to me,
""You’re drunk.""

1538437531354
1869
And then that’s when...
- Okay, but the part--

1538437533222
2970
- I saw red.

1538437536192
1735
- Whatever it is
that he said to you

1538437537927
2603
that set you off,
I understand.

1538437540530
1401
You have every right
to be mad;

1538437541931
1635
you have every right
to be upset.

1538437543566
2169
But I just don’t appreciate
the name-calling.

1538437545735
1735
That’s where it set me off...
- Right.

1538437547470
1435
- ’Cause that’s my husband.
- Well, of course.

1538437548905
1401
- That’s the father
of my children.

1538437550306
1835
- Of course.

1538437552142
1835
- So it’s like, you can say,
""I don’t agree with you.

1538437553977
1969
I don’t like
what you’re saying.""

1538437555945
1702
- Of course, but at the time--
- ""I’m not gonna talk to you.""

1538437557647
1401
- I didn’t know at the time
that was your husband.

1538437559048
1568
I probably wouldn’t
have reacted that way.

1538437560617
1368
- I understand.

1538437561985
1568
But I mean, regardless,
though,

1538437563553
2603
you shouldn’t say that
to anyone. [laughs]

1538437566156
2336
- Well, you shouldn’t tell
somebody that you’d kill them.

1538437568492
1668
- Oh, that is true.
Touché. That is true.

1538437570160
2236
- [laughs] I mean, you know,
you can’t be pointing fingers,

1538437572396
1502
’cause you have three
pointing back at you.

1538437573897
2169
- I should’ve never said that.
I was wrong.

1538437576066
1735
And I will--I will own that.

1538437577801
2102
- We both did things
that we’re embarrassed about.

1538437579903
1668
- Exactly.

1538437581572
3036
So I mean, I feel like
we both said our piece,

1538437584608
2069
we both said we were sorry
for what we said,

1538437586677
1568
and we need to just move on...
- I agree.

1538437588245
1602
- And get back to
where we were before,

1538437589847
1502
where we were...
- Before.

1538437591348
2636
[both laugh]

1538437593984
2769
- I think someone needs to be
designated to jump in

1538437596753
1935
and separate us immediately.
- Oh, yeah.

1538437598689
1735
- [laughs]

1538437600424
3036
We need, like, a--like,
a bodyguard for the two of us.

1835

1538437680170
1869
- He was a nice--
he was a nice guy.

1538437682038
2002
He was married for 30 years,

1538437684040
2970
and they realized they weren’t
meant for each other.

1538437687010
1502
- Did you hear from him again?

1538437688511
2769
- I was told the next day
that he wanted to--

1538437691280
1602
- I say go out
with somebody new.

1538437692882
1401
- I spoke to her today...
- Go again, again, like--

1538437694283
1735
- I spoke to her today,
and she said

1538437696019
1735
she has a couple more people
that she’d like to introduce.

1538437697754
2102
- Yeah, you--you need that.
- Yeah, yeah.

1538437699856
1368
- So you know what’s
interesting to me

1538437701224
3036
about your story...

1538437704260
3170
um, is that he was
with his wife

1538437707430
2536
and married for 30 years

1538437709966
1802
and then all of a sudden,
they just realized

1538437711768
2336
that, like, they’re not
meant for each other.

1538437714104
2503
So my husband, Matt’s,
not really here a lot,

1538437716606
2035
so it’s not really...

1538437718641
3070
on the table of
conversation a lot.

1538437721711
1835
And so, like, you guys--

1538437723546
2903
like, I don’t know, like, um...

1538437726449
1768
- Spit it out.
- It’s hard to say.

1538437728218
2736
So Matt and I, we’re--
so we’re splitting up.

1538437734791
1635
The space,

1538437736426
2836
like, let us, I guess,
both see it.

1538437739262
1568
- You mean the separation?
- The separation.

1538437740830
1468
I feel like I’ve been
separated almost.

1538437742299
1468
- How long has
he been living in L.A.?

1538437743767
2135
- Not too lo--
like, eight months.

1538437745902
2603
- That can’t be good
for anyone.

1538437748505
1602
- No, but almost--
- I mean, I’m not--

1538437750106
2903
- I’m not gonna lie. I thought
it was a little weird.

1538437753009
1535
Why doesn’t he just
move back home

1538437754544
1802
and see if you can
work that out?

1538437756346
1401
- He has to work.

1538437757747
1702
- You can’t get divorced
over a job,

1538437759449
3036
so it must be more than that.
- But it’s not that.

1538437762485
1735
I just feel like
we both realized

1538437764221
2736
that we got married
really young,

1538437766957
3136
and, like, we still are
really good friends,

1538437770093
1869
but we’re not in love.

1538437771961
1802
- When I was married to my ex,

1538437773763
1869
I just didn’t love him.

1538437775631
2736
I’m like, ""Don’t touch me.
I don’t wanna be with you.""

1538437778367
2069
- I actually still--
I actually still am

1538437780437
2336
even, like, super attracted to
Matt, so, like, that’s weird.

1538437782772
1702
- That’s the thing
that confuses me.

1538437784474
1668
- [laughs]
I know, ’cause he’s hot!

1538437786142
1134
- You tell me that
you’re attracted to him

1538437787277
1201
and he’s your best friend.

1538437788478
2302
- I’m so confused.

1538437790780
1935
- I just don’t want you
to regret it later.

1538437792715
1635
Grass is not always greener
on the other side.

1538437794350
1768
- Totally get that,
but I know what I know,

1538437796118
2402
and I’m actually making
a good decision

1538437798521
3036
before it turns
into a bad situation,

1538437801557
1802
and I don’t want that
for my children.

1538437803359
2436
- Right.
- I like your optimism,

1538437805795
1768
but I had it too.

1538437807563
1768
I was gonna do
everything as fair

1538437809332
1802
and amicable as possible,

1538437811134
2436
and at a certain point,
when it came down to,

1538437813570
2302
""Okay, how are
we gonna split it up?""

1538437815872
1535
- I know that that is
not going to happen

1538437817407
1568
in this situation.

1538437818975
2002
Matt is my best friend,

1538437820977
3003
and we will be best friends
for the rest of our lives.

1538437823980
2069
- I’m in the process
of a divorce right now,

1538437826048
2169
but that’s not what I wanted.

1538437828217
1668
You know, they have
three young kids,

1538437829886
1768
and it would be nice
to see them try and fight

1538437831655
1902
to keep their family together.

1538437833556

- We’re all here for you...
- I get that, and I--

1538437836026
1368
- And I don’t want you to think

1538437837394
1335
that we’re judging you
in any way.

1538437838728
1134
- I don’t feel that,

1538437839863
2569
and I appreciate...

1538437842432
1535

if I was helping her,

Plaque psoriasis
can be relentless.

1538437665376
934
TREMFYA® is for adults with

1538437666344
1535
moderate to severe
plaque psoriasis.

1538437668046
2169
With TREMFYA®,
you can get clearer.

1538437670248
1201
And stay clearer.

1538437671483
3403
In fact, most patients who saw
90% clearer skin at 28 weeks

1538437674920
2069
stayed clearer through 48 weeks.

1538437677022
1301
TREMFYA® works better than

1538437678356
1068
Humira® at providing

1538437679457
1435
clearer skin, and more patients

1538437680926
1602
were symptom free with TREMFYA®.

1538437682561
2202
TREMFYA® may lower your
ability to fight infections

1538437684796
1802
and may increase your
risk of infections.

1538437686765
1835
Before treatment, your
doctor should check you

1538437688633
1568
for infections and tuberculosis.

1538437690302
1535
Tell your doctor if
you have an infection

1538437691870
1101
or have symptoms such as:

1538437693004
2269
fever, sweats, chills,
muscle aches or cough.

1538437695440
2069
Before starting TREMFYA®
tell your doctor

1538437697542
2069
if you plan to or have
recently received a vaccine.

1538437699778
1935
Ask your doctor about TREMFYA®.

1538437701747
2469
TREMFYA®. Because you
deserve to stay clearer.

1168
month after month,

1538437832777
2936
the clock is ticking on

1538437835747
1668
Ongoing pain and stiffness

1538437837448
2002
are signs of joint erosion.

1538437839484
2202
HUMIRA can help stop the clock.

1538437841719
1401
Prescribed for 15 years,

1538437843154
2536
HUMIRA targets and blocks a
source of inflammation

1538437845723

Can you give me a hand
in making some posters?

1538438213781
1568
I‘m trying to advertise
my new business.

1538438215383
2503
What could you ever
offer the world
that anyone would pay for?

1538438217919
2269
We own a mower.
I got a beeper.

1538438220221
1602
Someone beeps me,
I rush over and tend to

1538438221856
1235
all their
landscaping needs.

1538438223124
2803
That‘s actually not
a bad idea.

1538438225960
1201
I know, right?

1538438227195
1869
I‘ve been posting signs
all over the neighborhood.

1538438230398
1568
""Barry, The Grass King.

1538438231999

""For all your grass needs.

1538438371005
2002
Hello?

1538438374141
1969
Dude, I’m glad
you finally got a girlfriend,

1538438376143
2669
but do you have to do
all that lovey-dovey stuff

1538438378846
1935
in front of those of us
who don’t?

1538438380814
1401
Actually, he
might have to.

1538438382249
2769
There’s an economic concept
known as a positional good

1538438385052
2703
in which an object is only
valued by the possessor

1538438387788
1668
because it’s not
possessed by others.

1538438389490
1468
The term was coined
in 1976

1538438390991
2202
by economist Fred Hirsch

1538438393227
1368
to replace
the more colloquial,

1538438394629
2669
but less precise
""neener-neener.""

1538438397331
1134
That’s not true.

1538438398499
1335
My happiness is not dependent

1538438399867
2436
on my best friend
being miserable and alone.

I would be dead without
health insurance.

1538438158307
2069
Dean Heller,
I was at the town hall

1538438160376
2002
when you promised to
protect our health care.

1538438162378
1335
But he broke his promise

1538438163713
3237
and voted to gut protections
for pre-existing conditions.

1538438167683
1368
He just caved to political

1538438169051
1568
pressure and corporate interests

1538438170620
1535
funding his campaign.

1538438172154
1969
This may just
be politics to him.

1538438174123
2102
But we’re fighting
for our lives.

1538438176225
2302
Dean Heller you
voted against us.

1538438178527
2002
It’s our turn to
vote against you.

1538438216265
2236
That’s where Adam Laxalt would
take education in Nevada.

1538438218567
1201
And his billionaire backers,

1538438219835
2469
the Koch Brothers, are
driving his decisions.

1538438222371
1835
They don’t like Governor
Sandoval’s law

1538438224273
4271
that puts a tiny piece of their
corporate profits to work
educating our kids.

1538438228610
2369
So Laxalt promised to reverse
the plan,

1538438231046
4471
which Sandoval says would cut
nearly $400 million from
Nevada classrooms.

1538438235584
4304
Sandoval says Laxalt’s plan
would ""permanently harm""
children.

1538438239955
4438
Adam Laxalt. He’d take
education in Nevada backwards.

The story of selling us out.

1538438246495
1535
Dean Heller tells
Governor Sandoval

1538438248030
1935
he’ll do the right thing
on healthcare.

1538438249965
1568
Then a Pro-Trump
dark money group

1538438251533
2069
threatened TV ads
to beat Heller.

1538438253602
1702
Heller meets
with President Trump...

1538438255304
2402
and the dark money group
takes down their ads.

1538438257707
1735
After threats from Trump,
Heller votes

1538438259442
2436
to let insurance companies
deny coverage

1538438261878
2269
for pre-existing conditions.

1538438264147
1435
His reward?

1538438265581
2836
A new dark money group pledges
to help Heller get re-elected.

1538438268417
1568
Dean Heller sold us out

1538438269986
1301
to save himself.

But, then, not
a word for months.

1538437511734
4938
Until, you’ll recall, January of
1997, when TARP was brought in

1538437516672
3370
for questioning after his
friend Ben Hobbs was arrested

1538437520042
3003
for a Nevada sexual
attack, which police said

1538437523045
3570
was similar to the
murder of Angie Dodge.

1538437526615
2035
I didn’t know what I
was being brought in for.

1538437528651
1735
You didn’t connect it
with the Angie thing at all?

1538437530386
1401
No.

I was going in for drugs.

KEITH MORRISON: And as
you’ve seen over the course

1538437535658
1835
of several weeks,
Chris Tapp soon

1538437537493
3170
went from saying he knew
nothing about Angie’s murder

1538437540663
3370
to being the only man
charged in the case,

1538437544033
2436
just as his mother warned him.

1538437546469
2503
How was your mother
during all of this?

1538437548971
934
Frantic.

1538437549906
1268
And I was honest with her.

1538437551174
2269
I said, I had nothing
to do with this, Mom.

1538437553442
4004
And I tried to explain to
her, I didn’t really confess.

1538437557446
3604
It took days to get
to a story where

1538437561050
1635
I actually made a confession.

1538437562685
2769
Well, of course, one of the
difficulties was your story.

1538437565454
1235
It kept changing, right?

1538437566689
1502
Very much it did.

1538437568190
1935
I mean, you went from
saying, I don’t know anything

1538437570126
3237
about this to then
saying, well, maybe Ben

1538437573362
1735
had something to do with it.

1538437575097
2803
To then, well, maybe there’s
a third guy involved,

1538437577900
3036
to, wait a minute, I was there.

1538437580937
3937
And, oh, yeah, I cut her.

1538437584874
1401
Where did that come from?

1538437586275
1768
Trying to give them
what they wanted to hear,

1538437588044
1001
just to appease them.

1538437589045
1034
Wait a minute.

1538437590079
1502
But why would you
say you cut her?

1538437591581
2503
Because, during that
time, Mr. Fuhriman,

1538437594083
2569
he said, hypothetically,
even if you did cut her,

1538437596653
1168
it still ain’t gonna matter.

1538437597820
1401
We’ll be able to get

1538437643266

Do you believe that story?

1538437645468
1134
Hook, line, and sinker.

1538437646602
1335
Try to put yourself
there right now

1538437647937

1538437650239

1538437652475

out what they want.

1538437654744
2236
and just for them
to leave me alone.

1538437656979
1068
Why?

1538437658047
1335
I didn’t kill nobody.

1538437659382
1735
I was never there the
night the murder happened.

1538437661117
2069
They just kept
focusing on, well,

1538437663186
2035
if you was there, if you did
do it, if you held a knife,

1538437665221
801
it’s OK.

1538437666022
1335
We will help you.

1538437667357
2569
So, like an idiot,
I believed them.

1538437669925
1702
And then they charged
you with murder.

1538437671627
1034
Yeah.

1168
KEITH MORRISON:
By now, of course,

1538437673829
2135
Chris Tapp was fighting
to clear his name.

1538437675965
1969
With the support not
only of his own mother

1538437677933
3070
and the Innocence Project
but of Carol Dodge,

1538437681004
1969
the victim’s mother.

1538437682972
4805
Carol Dodge came
around to your side.

1538437687777
1268
What was that like?

1538437689045
1635
It’s an amazing feeling.

1538437690680
5539

finally understanding

1538437696219

Is your dog trying to tell
you something?

1538437782471
1602
Licking, scratching, scooting,
and rubbing

1538437784107
1602
may be signs of allergic itch,

1538437785742
2135
a medical condition
that may require treatment.

1538437787910
1969
That’s why there’s
prescription APOQUEL:

1538437789912
1301
the revolutionary medicine

1538437791247
2236
that’s giving millions of dogs
the relief they deserve.

1538437793516
1468
Apoquel goes to
the source of the itch

1538437795017
2135
to provide relief
in as little as 4 hours.

1538437797186
634
WOOF

1538437797853
1101
And APOQUEL is safe

1538437798988
1835
without many of the side
effects associated

1538437800856
1168
with the use of steroids.

1538437802058
1602
APOQUEL is for
the control of itch

1538437803693
1935
associated with
allergic dermatitis

1538437805661
2436
and the control of atopic
dermatitis in dogs.

1538437808130
1268
Do not use APOQUEL in dogs

1538437809431
1034
less than 12 months old

1538437810499
1535
or those with serious
infections.

1538437812067
1101
APOQUEL may increase

1538437813202
1702
the chance of developing
serious infections

1538437814937
2369
and may cause existing
parasitic skin infestations

1538437817339
767
or pre-existing

1538437818140
1268
cancers to worsen.

1538437819442
2336
Do not use in breeding,
pregnant, or lactating dogs.

1538437821811
1101
Most common side effects

1538437822945
1301
are vomiting and diarrhea.

1538437824580
1034
Don’t wait.

1538437825648

Ask your veterinarian

about APOQUEL today.

APOQUEL.

It’s itch relief

KEITH MORRISON: More than 15
years after Angie Dodge was

1538437917473
3337
murdered on a quiet
street in Idaho Falls,

1538437920810
3070
something was about to change
in the case of her confessed

1538437923880
1802
killer, Christopher Tapp.

1538437925681
4738
For the first time since his
trial, a hearing on evidence

1538437930419
2135
was about to be
held before a judge.

1538437932554
2236
And as Chris Tapp
entered the courtroom,

1538437934790
3370
he and his supporters
finally had reason for hope.

1538437938160
2202
Not that the judge could
review the evidence

1538437940363
2636
and just declare Tapp innocent.

1538437942999
3871
No, this would have to be based
strictly on points of law.

1538437946869
2035
And those Court of Appeals
had, over the years,

1538437948905
3470
thrown out all but one of
Tapp’s videotaped interviews.

1538437952374
3871
That being the one where he
said he took part in the crime.

1538437956245
3570
But, in this hearing, it
could be thrown out too

1538437959815
3504
if the court decided Tapp
believed he was ""in custody""

1538437963319
2636
when he said those
incriminating things.

1538437965955
3337
If he thought he was unable
to leave this little room.

1538437969291
2336
Because that would
have violated his

1538437971627
2970
basic constitutional rights.

1538437974597
2469
Tapp’s attorneys, Dennis
Benjamin and John Thomas.

1538437977066
1468
What’s the best
result from this?

1538437978534
1201
A new trial?

1538437979735
2469
Or is it possible to
have an exoneration?

1538437982204
4404
If this confession goes, the
state has almost no evidence.

1538437986609
2769
I think they’d have
to dismiss the case.

1538437989378
1201
KEITH MORRISON: The
stakes could not

1538437990579
2703
have been higher for Mr. Tapp.

1538437993282
2503
His mother Vera sat
right behind him.

1538437995785
2069
Carol Dodge was there too.

1538437997853
2102
Two of her sons also.

1538437999955
1668
They’ve got a lot at stake.

1538438001624
3103
If Chris Tapp walks
free, then what?

1538438004727
2469
Then it’s, who is the killer?

1538438007196
1235
KEITH MORRISON: The
prosecution would

1538438008431
1568
rely on the word
of the detective

1538438009999
3570
who later became Idaho
Falls Mayor, Jared Fuhriman.

1538438013569
1702
Fuhriman ran the
police interviews

1538438015271
3737
and said Chris Tapp was
never technically in custody.

1538438019008
1602
Was Chris Tapp free to leave?

1538438020610
1435
Yes.

1538438022044
1668
KEITH MORRISON: That’s
funny, Chris Tapp’s lawyers

1538438023713
1668
argued when it was their turn.

1538438025381
3670
How could a 20-year-old, who had
been arrested twice and watched

1538438029051
5405
as the door was actually barred
during some of his interviews--

1538438034456
1435
KEITH MORRISON: --how
could that young man,

1538438035891
2436
who had been questioned on
and off for nearly a month,

1538438038327
3237
who had spend more than a week
of that time actually locked up

1538438041563
3237
in jail, who had watched as
immunity deals were offered

1538438044800
2636
and then later torn up--

1538438047436
1935
how could that kid,
the lawyer asked,

1538438049371
2769
be expected to believe he
could leave whenever he wanted?

1538438052140
1869
Did you think that
if you decided not

1538438054009
1902
to talk to the
police, that you were

1538438055911
1235
going to be able to go home?

1538438057145
2169
No, I would not have
been allowed to go home.

1538438059314
1468
KEITH MORRISON: But
Tapp had to acknowledge,

1538438060782
2069
when he was questioned
by the prosecutor,

1538438062851
4571
he had indeed lied over
the years, many times,

1538438067422
3604
including in sworn affidavits
used in past appeals.

1538438071026
2903
You’ve admitted the
fact that you lied

1538438073929
2436
on any number of occasions.

1538438076365
4805
And if you lied before,
how can we believe you now?

1538438081170
1935
Of course they’re going
to say I’m a liar now.

1538438083105
1368
He’s just trying
to save himself.

1538438084473
1502
But it’s the truth.

1538438085975
1168
I’m innocent.

1538438087143
2936
I’ve never committed this crime.

1538438090079
1368
KEITH MORRISON: When
testimony was over,

1538438091447
1668
it was up to the judge.

1538438093115
3203
Would he order a new trial for
Chris Tapp or would he send him

1538438096318
4705
back to prison, maybe for good?

1538438101023
3470
And, then, four months
later, a ruling.

1538438104493
2569
Chris Tapp was never
threatened, restrained,

1538438107062
5172
or handcuffed, said the judge,
and thus was not in custody.

1538438112234
2402
Appeal denied.

1538438114637
3737
It’s a corny line, but the
truth will set me free someday.

1538438118374
3136
And you’re pretty
convinced of that?

1538438121510
2870
As the years go on, yeah.

1538438124380
2569
KEITH MORRISON: Tapp’s lawyers
vowed to continue that fight

1538438126949
1835
for as long as they had to.

1538438128784
2102
And for the first
time since the murder,

1538438130886
3537
the two mothers at the center
of the case could agree.

1538438134423
4304
You come home every day
and you think, I had a son.

1538438142064
3270
Sooner or later,
something’s gotta break.

1538438145334
1802
Let him go.

1538438147136
3971
It’s the only thing
his mother has.

1538438151107
1802
It’s her only child.

1538438152908
1368
Let him enjoy his mother.

1538438154277
2336
Let his mother enjoy him.

1538438156612
1268
There’s just two of them.

1538438157880
2536
That’s all they have.

1538438160416
2369
KEITH MORRISON: And Chris’s
case was far from over.

1538438162785
2236
There were more
motions, more hearings.

1538438165021
2336
It all was the
same result. Then,

1538438167356
2269
two decades after his
conviction, in March,

1538438169625
3770
2017, a stunning twist.

1538438173396
2669
Prosecutors offered
Chris Tapp a plea deal,

1538438176065
2669
downgrading his conviction
to second-degree murder

1538438178734
2169
and vacating his
rape conviction.

1538438180903
2102
Chris had a decision to make.

1538438183005
1668
This was not an exoneration.

1538438184674
2436
He’d still be a killer
in the eyes of the law,

1538438187109
2336
but he’d be a free man.

1538438189445
3270
He accepted and was
resentenced of time

1538438192715
3070
served, no probation or parole.

1538438195784
5272
After 20 years behind bars, he
left the hearing a free man.

1538438201056
1401
REPORTER: How are you feeling?

1538438202457
1235
Overwhelmed.

1538438203692
1935
Completely, totally overwhelmed.

1538438205627
1201
KEITH MORRISON:
As for Ben Hobbs,

1538438206829
2870
he’s still in prison in
Nevada, and still denies

1538438209699
2503
any involvement
in Angie’s murder.

1538438212201
4271
He declined ""Dateline’s""
request for an interview.

1538438216471
2970
For Dr. Greg Hampikian of
the Idaho Innocence Project,

1538438219441
3904
the answer still lies not
in the machinery of law,

1538438223345
1535
but in science.

1538438224880
3370
That DNA left at the
scene, it points, he says,

1538438228250
1902
to the simplest explanation.

1538438230152
6139
Not to a third man, or even
a second one, by just one.

1538438236292
1235
What are the
chances that a story

1538438237526
2269
can remain a secret
for that many years

1538438239795
1335
if three people were involved?

1538438241130
2503
Secrets can be
kept, but, you know,

1538438243632
2069
science reveals those secrets.

1538438245701
5506
Somebody went in and committed
a typical, violent rape-murder

1538438251206
2269
and left typical evidence.

1538438253475
3704
There is no other
person there by DNA.

1538438257179
1902
Where is he?

1538438259080
1602
KEITH MORRISON: Where indeed.

1538438260682
3003
And Carol Dodge
is still tortured,

1538438263685
2469
still pondering
that last message

1538438266154
4738
from her Angie, that she
had done something stupid.

1538438270893
3770
It sounds to me like you
believe that she had crossed

1538438274663
2936
or double-crossed somebody
who was very dangerous.

1538438277600
2302
She had crossed the line and
didn’t have any clue of what

1538438279902
3103
she had gotten herself into.

1538438283005
3337
KEITH MORRISON: And neither
did she, Carol admits,

1538438286342
3504
when she set out on a
quest to find the killer.

1538438289844
1301
Not finished.

1538438291146
1401
Not yet.

1538438292547
2302
CAROL DODGE: I’m never
gonna stop looking.

1538438294849
4204
One day I’m going to
look that man in the eye.

1538438299054
3070
One day he will be found.

1538438302123
3437
He’ll be found.

1538438305560
1702
That’s all for this
edition of ""Dateline.""

1538438307262

No mate, there are no beans in

Unlike cable providers,

1538438394209

the price you see is
the price you pay.

1538438396946

Forty dollars a month for 100

IN THE BOARDROOM.

1538437720746
2202
little things can be a big deal.

1538437722949
1535
That’s why there’s Otezla.

1538437724484
2669
Otezla is not an injection
or a cream.

1538437727153
2402
It’s a pill that
treats differently.

1538437729555
1034
For psoriasis,

1538437730590
2302
75% clearer skin is achievable,

1538437732892
968
with reduced redness,

1538437733859
1869
thickness, and scaliness
of plaques.

1538437735728
1502
And for psoriatic arthritis,

1538437737230
1468
Otezla is proven to reduce

1538437738731
2102
joint swelling,
tenderness, and pain.

1538437740833
1635
And the Otezla
Prescribing information

1538437742468
2569
has no requirement for
routine lab monitoring.

1538437745037
2069
Don’t use if you’re
allergic to Otezla.

1538437747106
1835
Otezla may cause
severe diarrhea,

1538437748941
1301
nausea, or vomiting.

1538437750276
1568
Tell your doctor
if these occur.

1538437751844
1335
Otezla is
associated with

1538437753179
1635
an increased risk of
depression.

1538437754814
1134
Tell your doctor
if you have

1538437755948
2035
a history of depression
or suicidal thoughts,

1538437757984
1635
or if these feelings
develop.

1538437759619
1268
Some people taking Otezla

1538437760887
1235
reported weight loss.

1538437762121
1435
Your doctor should
monitor your weight

1538437763556
1168
and may stop treatment.

1538437764724
1201
Other side effects
include

1538437765925

1538437853879

1538437856549
1768
A plan like this helps pay

1538437858317
1668
some of what Medicare doesn’t.

1538437859985
2135
So you could end up
paying less.

Am I just being silly?

1538437723783
1401
Oh, I don’t think
you’re being silly.

1538437725285
601
Oh, god.

1538437725986
1435
You know what?

1538437727520
1201
I can just sell it and put
the money in the party fund.

1538437728821
1034
Oh.

1538437729956
1134
Then another woman will get it.

1538437731190
801
We can’t allow that.

1538437732091
667
We have to destroy it.

1538437732859

Come on.

1538437749142

1538437750544
834
Thank you.

1538437751478
734
Cool.

1538437752312

1538437756616

That’s racist.

1538437758151
1468
I don’t know.

1538437759720
5072
But I would say by looking at
him, no, Darryl does not swim.

1538437764891
1735
It’s all right.

1538437766726
901
Yes!

1538437767727
1835
[interposing voices]

1538437770831

1538437775001

- Yeah.

1538437780006

We didn’t win.

1538437823917

1538437824851
701
Hey, Dwight, it’s OK.

1538437825652

- No.

1538437826720
1301

- Just rest.

1538437828121

1538437841401

Oh.

1538437842435

Phyllis’s birthday.

1538437843836

1538437848674
1435
Rawr!

1538437850209
1702
[laughs] And to think,
I always thought

1538437852011
2970
of her as a second Meredith.

1538437855081
2870
Respectfully, I don’t want us
walking into a similar Angela

1538437858051
1435
kind of situation.

1538437859586
3003
So I just want to make sure
that you are completely 100%

1538437862689

1538437865258
2536

I’m with Jessica.

1538437867894
3070
And I like to get my monog on.

1538437871064
2035
It’s monogamy for my hog and me.

1538437873199
1001
- Not what I asked.
- We’re done.

1538437874301
868
- OK.
- Erin and I are--

1538437875268
1168
- Good.
- --over.

1538437876536
1435
So then you won’t
mind if tonight I just

1538437878071

go crazy on her, just go nuts.

1538437881508
1201

1538437629940
2169
I was just wondering
if I could talk to you.

1538437632142
1335
It’s about Leonard.

1538437633510
1468
Why me?

1538437635012
1802
Why not Koothrappali
or Wolowitz?

1538437636847
3103
Well, Raj can’t talk
to me unless he’s drunk,

1538437639984
2569
and Wolowitz is, you
know, disgusting.

1538437642586
2769
Yes, I suppose he is.

1538437646857
2736
All I’m saying is,
you know Leonard the best.

1538437649626
1835
Not necessarily.

1538437651495
1502
I’m often surprised

1538437653030
1802
by my lack of familiarity
with Leonard.

1538437654865
1568
Just the other day
I discovered

1538437656467
1602
he not only has
a loofah,

1538437658102
1702
he hides it.

1538437659837
2669
Why do you suppose a man
would be ashamed of
having a loofah?

1538437662539
2508
I, myself, prefer to have
my excess epithelial cells

1538437665081
1401
slough off naturally,
but I don’t condemn

1538437666515
3237
those who seek
to accelerate the process.

1538437669785
2803
...and until recently
I had no idea

1538437672621
1869
that despite his
lactose intolerance,

1538437674523
2603
he can tolerate small
amounts of non-fat ice cream

1538437677159
1902
without producing a noxious
gas that I maintain,

1538437679095
2903
in the right concentration,
could be weaponized.

1538437682031
3036
Leonard might come home.

1538437685101
1001
Can we talk in my apartment?

1538437686135
3103
We’re not done?

1538437689271
1468
No.

1538437690773
1301
Eh, why not?

1538437692107
1902
We’re already through
the looking glass anyway.

1538437698547
2703
Okay, so here’s the thing...

1538437701283
2970
I guess you’re aware
that Leonard asked me out.

1538437704286
1902
Well, he didn’t actually
say anything,

1538437706221
1835
but when he came back
to the apartment

1538437708090
1935
he was doing a dance
that brought to mind

1538437710059
2302
the happy hippos in Fantasia.

1538437712394
2336
Oh, that’s nice.

1538437714763
2102
Anyhow, the thing I wanted
to talk to you about

1538437716899
2135
is, you know, since Leonard
and I have become friends...

1538437719068
1068
I was just...

1538437720169
1935
You want to sit down?

1538437722137
2970
Oh, I wish it were that simple.

1538437726642
1602
See, I don’t spend
much time here,

1538437728276
2236
and so I’ve never really chosen
a place to sit.

1538437730545
2069
Well, choose.

1538437732648
3136
There are a number
of options, and...

1538437735817
2402
I’m really not familiar enough
with the cushion densities,

1538437738253
2469
air flow patterns
and dispersion of sunlight

1538437740756
2202
to make an informed choice.

1538437742991
1802
All right, why don’t you
just pick one at random

1538437744826
2069
and if you don’t like it you can
sit somewhere else next time.

1538437746928
2135
No, no. That’s crazy.

1538437750333
3570
You go ahead and talk
while I figure it out.

1538437753936
1869
Okay.

1538437755838
2302
Um, here’s the thing.

1538437758174
1935
So I’ve known for
a while now

1538437760142
1101
that Leonard has had

1538437761276
1535
a little crush on me...

1538437762844
1869
A little crush?

1538437764746
3103
Well, I suppose so--
in the same way Menelaus

1538437767883
2436
had a ""little crush""
on Helen of Troy.

1538437770352
2870
All right, yeah, I don’t
really know who they are, but...

1538437773255
1668
Well, Menelaus was the
brother of Agamemnon...

1538437774957
1201
I don’t care. I don’t care.
Listen.

1538437776191
2402
The point is,

1538437778627
2870
Leonard isn’t the kind of guy
I usually go out with.

1538437781530
3770
Leonard isn’t the kind of guy
anyone usually goes out with.

1538437785334
3570
Would you be open
to rotating the couch
clockwise 30 degrees?

1538437788937
1635
No. What I’m saying is

1538437790606
2936
Leonard might be
different in a good way.

1538437793575
3504
Obviously, my usual choices
have not worked out so well.

1538437797112
2202
Your last one worked out
well for Koothrappali.

1538437799348
1969
He got a free iPod.

1538437803085
1969
Oh, glare.

1538437805087
3036
But on the other hand, if things
don’t go well with Leonard,

1538437808157
2102
I risk losing a
really good friend.

1538437810292
2002
I mean, I’m guessing he’s not
looking for a fling.

1538437812328
1869
He’s the kind of guy that
gets into a relationship

1538437814230
2102
for, I don’t know,
like you would say,
light-years.

1538437816365
1235
I would not say that.

1538437817633
1969
No one would say that.

1538437819635
2769
A light-year is a unit
of distance not time.

1538437822438
2202
Thank you for the clarification.

1538437831013
2903
Draft.

1538437833949
1802
See, people hear
the word ""year""

1538437835785
1602
and they think duration.

1538437837420
1735
""Foot-pound"" has the
same problem--

1538437839188
1969
that’s a unit of work,
not of weight.

1538437841190
968
Right. Thanks.

1538437842191
1001
It’s a common mistake.

1538437843225
2569
Not the first one
I’ve made today.

1538437845828
1735
Okay.

1538437847596
3871
I think this will be my seat.

1538437851500
1301
Sheldon, do you have
anything to say

1538437852835
1535
that has anything to do with,
you know,

1538437854403
1502
what I’m talking about?

1538437855938
2870
Well, let’s see...

1538437858841
2169
We might consider
Schrodinger’s cat.

1538437861043
1768
Schrodinger?

1538437862845
1401
Is that the woman in 2A?

1538437864280
1468
No, that’s Mrs. Grossinger.

1538437865781
2169
And she doesn’t have a cat,
she has a Mexican hairless.

1538437867984
1335
Annoying little animal.
Yip, yip, yip, yip.

1538437869352
1568
Sheldon.

1538437870953
2503
Sorry, you diverted me.

1538437873489
3904
Anyway, in 1935,
Erwin Schrodinger,

1538437877426
2035
in an attempt to explain
the Copenhagen interpretation

1538437879495
1068
of quantum physics,

1538437880596
1335
he proposed
an experiment

1538437881964
3637
where a cat is placed in a
box with a sealed vial of poison

1538437885634
2169
that will break open
at a random time.

1538437887836
1635
Now, since no one
knows when

1538437889504
2469
or if the poison
has been released,

1538437892007
1735
until the box is opened,

1538437893775
3670
the cat can be thought of
as both alive and dead.

1538437901416
2636
I’m sorry.
I don’t get the point.

1538437904086
2102
Well, of course you don’t get
it; I haven’t made it yet.

1538437908691
1235
You’d have to be psychic
to get it,

1538437909959
1034
and there’s no such
thing as ""psychic.""

1538437911027
1101
Sheldon, what’s the point?!

1538437912161
2803
Just like Schrodinger’s cat,

1538437914997
2269
your potential relationship
with Leonard right now

1538437917299
2102
can be thought of
as both good and bad.

1538437919435
1535
It is only by
opening the box

1538437921003
2503
that you’ll find out
which it is.

1538437923539
3704
Okay, so you’re saying I should
go out with Leonard.

1538437927276
2002
No, no, no, no, no.

1538437930379
1368
Let me start again.

1538437931780
2202
In 1935,
Erwin Schrodinger...

1538437935350
2836
Two seats right there.

1538437940022
2870
Chung shu shway?

1538437944459
1435
Xie xie.

1538437950298
1602
Sheldon, I think I’ve
made a mistake.

1538437951933
1301
I can see that.

1538437953268
1602
Unless you’re planning on
running a marathon,

1538437954903
1702
choosing both stuffing
and mashed potatoes

1538437956638
2102
is a starch-filled redundancy.

1538437958774
1902
No, it’s about Penny.

1538437960709
2302
A mistake involving Penny.

1538437963045
2803
Okay, you’ll have
to narrow it down.

1538437965881
3170
I don’t think I can go out
with her tonight.

1538437969084
1468
Then don’t.

1538437970586
2469
Other people would
say ""Why not?""

1538437973088
2636
Other people might
be interested.

1538437975757
2135
I’m going to talk anyway.

1538437977926
2302
I assumed you would.

1538437980262
2636
Now that I’m actually
about to go out with Penny,

1538437982931
2469
I’m not excited-- I’m nauseous.

1538437985434
2169
Ah, then your meal choice
is appropriate.

1538437987637
2402
Starch absorbs fluid which
reduces the amount of vomit

1538437990072
2336
available for violent expulsion.

1538437992441
1869
Right.
You also made

1538437994343
1568
a common grammatical mistake.

1538437995945
2102
You said ""nauseous,""
when you meant ""nauseated.""

1538437998781
1935
But go on.

1538438000749
3103
Sheldon, this date is probably
my one chance with Penny.

1538438003886
1602
What happens if I blow it?

1538438005521
1802
Well, if we accept your premise

1538438007356
3437
and also accept the highly
improbable assumption

1538438010826
3003
that Penny is the only woman
in the world for you,

1538438013863
1435
then we can logically
conclude that the result

1538438015331
1668
of blowing it would be that
you end up

1538438017033
2669
a lonely, bitter old man
with no progeny.

1538438019735
2202
The image of any number
of evil lighthouse keepers

1538438021970
2769
from Scooby-Doo cartoons
comes to mind.

1538438024773
2636
You’re not helping.

1538438027442
1635
All right, what response
on my part

1538438029111
2135
would bring this conversation
to a speedy conclusion?

1538438031280
2236
Tell me whether or not
to go through with the date.

1538438033549
2035
Schrodinger’s cat.

1538438035617
3370
Wow, that’s brilliant.

1538438039021

1538438078661

Okay, yeah, great.

1538438079995
1401
Listen, um...

1538438081430
1735
maybe we should talk first.

1538438083199
2069
Oh.

1538438085301
1268
Okay.

1538438087903
1435
But before you
say anything,

1538438089371
3003
have you ever heard of
Schrodinger’s cat?

1538438094410
3570
Actually, I’ve heard far too
much about Schrodinger’s cat.

1538438098013
1335
Good.

1538438105020
1802
All right, the cat’s alive.

Not only did we find
lots of options,

1538438225874

but we were like, oh my

1538438227709

It‘s affordable no matter

1538438229611

It‘s really the best pricing.

But Seattle’s huge, new

1538438172400

Seattle admitted that their huge
new tax could lead to

1538438175703
1902
higher prices for meat and
poultry.

1538438177638
2302
And there’s a real threat that
food,

1538438179974
1702
like beef and
dairy, could be next.

1538438181709

Washington state
doesn’t tax groceries,

1538438184545

but a loophole says that
local governments can.

Turns out, Dino Rossi

1538438231225
2603
not only voted against
struggling families,

1538438233861
2803
but he tried to profit
from their misery, too.

1538438236697
2703
As a real-estate investor,
Rossi taught a seminar

1538438239434
2269
on how to profit
when people lost their homes

1538438241735
1802
during
the foreclosure crisis.

1538438243570
2169
And Rossi kept working
with a shady investor,

1538438245773
2269
even as he was indicted
for fraud.

1538438248075
1535

My husband was a high school
math teacher for 25 years

1538438289818
2069
when he was diagnosed with ALS.

1538438291920

My son is caring for my husband
full time so I can keep working.

1538438295257
1902
And I don’t know how
else we’d afford this.

1538438297192
4304
If Jeff Johnson were governor,
our family would be devastated.

1538438301530
2636
Jeff Johnson’s health care plan
would raise insurance rates

1538438304199
3103
and could deny coverage for
pre-existing conditions.

1538438307335
2336
Jeff Johnson would push
us to the brink financially

1538438309704
2703
so the insurance companies
could make more money.

1538438312441
2569
Jeff Johnson is not
the governor we need.

1538438322418
2035
I’m Angie Craig, and I know,

1538438324487
2002
because I watched
my mom struggle

1538438326522
3103
with a stack full of bills
on the kitchen table

1538438329659
2202
when we went
without health insurance.

1538438331894
1802
It’s why I’ve made improving

1538438333729
1935
healthcare my life’s work.

1538438335698
1935
If healthcare isn’t affordable,

1538438337667
1134
it’s not accessible.

1538438338834
2636
I’m Angie Craig,
and I approve this message,

1538438341503
1301
because we’ve got to reform

1538438342838
1368
our healthcare system

1538438344239
2202
and cut costs for people now.

1538438378707

Student loans and the GI Bill

1538438383846

made college possible.

1538438385281

As a teacher and dad, I’ve seen
the difference education makes.

1538438393722
1969
I’ll fight for affordable Pre-K,

1538438395724
2269
fully fund our schools,

1538438398026
3303
and expand technical education
to open new career paths.

1301
Great job, man.

1538437509073
1835
But after such a close call
with the floor stain,

1538437510908
2402
Hilary is keeping a close eye
on everything,

1538437513311
1435
right down to making sure
the wood

1538437514745
2636
for the harvest table
works with the floors.

1538437517381
2236
Look at how much flooring
we have that is,

1538437519617
1401
you know, the oak...
-Right.

1538437521018
2736
...and this has to
contrast or complement.

1538437523754
2536
Okay, this is the one
that I want to choose,

1538437526290
2703
and then, if not,
I quite like this.

1538437528993
1635
Oh, great.

1538437530627

NARRATOR:
With the wood selected,

2970
Hilary’s team puts the final
touches on Jimmy and Lisa’s home

1538437535165
3737
with the hope of
inspiring Lisa to stay.

1538437538902
3136
As for David, he’s hardly
ready to concede defeat

1538437542039
2836
and is making good use
of Jimmy and Lisa’s

1538437544875
2236
new $800,000
purchasing budget.

1538437547111
4805
I don’t believe it, but I
actually found a house

1538437551916
1969
for Jimmy and Lisa

1538437553884
2336
that is not only
on a golf course,

1538437556220
3537
it’s on their golf course --

1538437559757
5305
five bedrooms, four bathrooms,
a beautiful main floor,

1538437565063
2936
a master bedroom
that has a walkout

1538437567999
3036
overlooking their golf course.

1538437571035
3437
It could be over
for Hilary Farr.

1538437574472
1468
Welcome to your golf course.

1538437575940
1702
-It’s on the golf course.
-Sweet, finally.

1538437577642
1568
I’m so excited.
-Let’s check it out.

1538437579210
3470
Let’s go.

1538437582680
1235
DAVID: Come on in.

1538437583915
1835
LISA: It’s so open.
It’s very welcoming.

1538437585750
1802
-What’s in here?
-What about this room?

1538437587552
2469
This is going to be
your office space.

1538437590021
1301
Okay.

1538437591322
1468
Now, you probably want to make
it a little more private

1538437592790
1635
with some glass doors

1538437594425
2169
so that you have
a perfect sight line

1538437596594
2469
into what is going to be
the homework area.

1538437599063
2736
Well, isn’t that what Hilary
is doing in our house?

1538437601799
1001
Yeah, and?

1538437602800
1401
So we would have
more work to do?

1538437604202
1401
A little bit.
Here’s the kicker.

1538437605603
1835
You’re not
on the golf course.
I know.

1538437607438
1635
Let’s go to the place
where you’re gonna

1538437609073
2736
actually see the view.
Look at this window.

1538437611809
2135
You come in through here.
Look at that walkout.

1538437613944
1235
LISA: Yeah.
This is nice.

1538437615179
1335
Can you imagine entertaining
with your friends

1538437616514
1468
flowing back and forth
between the screened-in porch?

1538437617982
1335
Yeah, the kitchen is nice.

1538437619316
1301
JIMMY: I think the best thing
about the kitchen is the view.

1538437620618
2469
Well, then,
let’s go out there.

1538437623087
1168
LISA: This is nice.

1538437624255
1435
Ninth hole, beautiful spot.

1538437625689
1668
DAVID: Yeah, I mean, this is
exactly what you wanted.

1538437627358
2336
I’m starting to like
this house, David.

1538437629693
901
-Okay, come on.
-Okay.

1538437630594
2569
-We got more to see.
-Yeah.

1538437633163
1902
Access to
your two-car garage.

1538437635065
1168
JIMMY:
This is a good size.

1538437636233
3070
But this is not going
to be your man cave.

1538437639303
1401
I’ve got a better spot
for you in the house.

1538437640704
1368
I like the sound of that.

1538437642072
1535
I can’t remember.
Is Hilary giving you a man cave?

1538437643607
1468
We’re not getting one.

1538437645075
3437
Man cave is no-no.

1538437648512
1635
Lots more to see.
Let’s go.

1538437650147
2035
Okay.

1538437652183
1869
Oh, is this, like,
a little guest room?

1538437654051
1502
This would make
a great guest room

1538437655553
1435
because
there’s a guest bath...

1538437656987
1068
-Oh, okay.
-...right across the hall.

1538437658055
1635
-Great.
-All right.

1538437659690
1969
We are heading
to the second floor.

1538437661659
1001
The bathroom.
-Great.

1538437662660
3670
This is what we want
Hilary to build.

1538437666330
1301
Really good-size bedroom.

1538437667632
1201
This is nice, good score.

1538437668833
1702
Yeah, great.

1538437670534
1802
Second-floor laundry.

1538437672336
1535
Yay!

1538437673871
1535
Bedroom number two
up here,

1538437675406
1602
they’ve got it set up
as an office.

1538437677007
1869
Obviously, you’d be using it
as a bedroom.

1538437678875
1301
Yeah.

1538437680177
1168
JIMMY: I’m hoping the master
is facing the course.

1538437681345
2436
I guess we’ll see, honey.

1538437683780
1835
Look at the view.

1538437685615
1001
Gorgeous.

1538437686617
1101
-Hon, look at this.
-Oh, nice.

1538437687718
2035
There’s, like,
a deck out here.

1538437689754
1401
This is nice.
This is beautiful.

1538437691155
2035
DAVID: It doesn’t matter what
Hilary does to your house,

1538437693190
1034
it’s never going
to be like this.

1538437694225
1602
Right.

1538437695826
1201
-Okay.
-The master bath.

1538437697027
1368
-Wow.
-Yeah, it’s big.

1538437698395
934
LISA:
Yeah, this is great.

1538437699329
1235
I got something for Jimmy.

1538437700564
2736
-Yeah. Let’s see it.
-All right. Let’s do it.

1538437703300
2903
DAVID: The man cave
overlooking the golf course.

1538437706203
1568
Yeah, score.
Good job, David.

1538437707772
968
-I like it.
-Crushed it.

1538437708739
1902
Also,
what could be in here?

1538437710641
1201
-This is the fifth bedroom.
-Yeah.

1538437711842
1034
LISA: See, this is where
we’d put James.

1538437712877
1268
This is cool.

1538437714145
1001
And if James is here,

1538437715146
1201
you’ve got the bathroom
right there.

1538437716347
1602
Yeah. No.
This is great.

1538437717948
1335
So I think
when you add it up,

1538437719283
2870
this house really does deliver
most of what you need.

1538437722153
2836
-I like it.
-Absolutely.

1538437724989
2703
You said we could look
at houses up to $800,000.

1538437727691
1101
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1538437728792
1568
What do you think
this house is listed at?

1538437730360
1702
$800,000.

1538437732062
1768
$825,000.

1538437733831
3203
This house is listed
at $819,000.

1538437737034
1602
-Okay, in between what we said.
-Wow, yeah.

1538437738635
1768
And I know that this
is way above

1538437740404
1768
your original budget
of $700,000.

1538437742173
1902
I think we all know
how much it costs

1538437744074
1168
to be on a golf course.

1538437745242
2069
It has the bare bones
that we need.

1538437747311
1468
It just needs some work.

1538437748779
2236
Pound for pound,
it’s got everything that we need

1538437751014
2769
in the spot
that we want to be in.

1538437753784
1068
LISA: It’s a nice house.

1538437754851

1802
the house is still over budget.

1538438285382
1568
Hilary was able to stick
to the budget

1538438286950
3303
she was given and delivered
a completely redesigned kitchen,

1538438290253
2202
dining and kids’ study area.

1538438292456
2202
She also created
a new second-floor bathroom

1538438294658
1235
and laundry,

1538438295892
2803
and she turned the master
bathroom into an oasis.

1538438298695
1802
The only thing she
couldn’t do within budget

1538438300497
2102
was transform the attic
into a guest room

1538438302599
1568
and man cave for Jimmy.

1538438304167
2236
-The kitchen is gorgeous.
-It’s beautiful.

1538438306402
1201
I’ll be honest.

1538438307604
1969
This is a better kitchen
than the one I showed them.

1538438309572
1368
-""I’ll be honest""?
-Yes.

1538438310940
1835
Okay, well, let’s just know
that you’re not.

1538438312775
1134
But I’m always honest.

1538438313910
1835
The other house had
a screened-in porch

1538438315745
1201
overlooking the golf course.
-I know. I know.

1538438316946
1134
That’s hard to find.

1538438318081
2970
The directive I got was,
if Jimmy is gonna move,

1538438321050
1468
it’s gonna have to be
on a golf course.

1538438322518
1935
$819,000...

1538438324454
1335
-It’s a lot of money.
-...it’s a lot of money.

1538438325788
1802
I couldn’t
finish the attic

1538438327590
1335
because they wouldn’t
give me another dime.

1538438328925
1268
It had the third floor.

1538438330193
1201
Yeah, the third floor
that was already finished.

1538438331395
1168
It was already finished.

1538438332562
1368
But we do have stairs up
to the attic here now.

1538438333930
1201
-So we could do that here.
-Right.

1538438335132
1368
So you think you had
a harder job,

1538438336500
1735
but I had to deal
with a real-estate market

1538438338235
1802
that most people
don’t understand.

1538438340037
2135
Oh, that’s so tough.
It’s awful.

1538438342172
1034
-Oh.
-Aw.

1538438343206
1468
I think
I made my decision.

1538438344674
1502
-Let’s go tell them.
-Okay.

1538438347710
2469
Okay, so decision made?

1538438350180
1435
Yeah,
we made our decision.

1538438351614
1869
And are you
going to love it?

1538438353483
2102
Or are you
going to list it?

1538438355585
3837
♪

1538438359422
2369
We’re going to love it.

1538438361791
1201
Yes!

1538438362992
1768
DAVID: You don’t want to be
on the golf course?

1538438364761
2069
We loved and would want to be
on the golf course,

1538438366829
2369
but the kitchen is gorgeous.

1538438369199
1635
There’s another bathroom
for the kids here.

1538438370833
1902
-I’m thrilled.
-It’s great.

1538438372735
1435
I know from the beginning
I thought

1538438374170
1802
that Hilary would
do a great job.

1538438375972
2936
It’s not just beautiful,
but it’s functional, you know?

1538438378908
2202
We have more space and
more space for the kids,

1538438381110
1969
and this is exactly
what we need right now.

1538438383079
1668
Yeah.

1538438384747
2369
Clearly, they don’t love golf
as much as they said they did.

1538438387116
2669
They don’t love golf as much
as you hoped that they did.

1538438389785
2402
I think that’s your problem,
not their problem.

1538438392188
2536
Yes, but I could have found
them a fantastic house

1538438394724
1735
if it wasn’t
on a golf course.

1538438396459
1869
That’s true, but still
not as good as this

1538438398327
1001
because this was one

1538438399328
1802
of the most astounding
renovations.

CATE HARRIS WAS A STAGE NAME
FOR CATHERINE HEATHRIDGE,

1538437566022
1134
A TEXTILE HEIRESS.

1538437567256
1869
HER FAMILY KEPT
THE PSEUDONYM

1538437569225
1768
FOR HER MEDICAL ADMISSION
TO PROTECT THEIR PRIVACY.

1538437571094
1702
ACCORDING TO
THE INTAKE REPORT,

1538437572895
3637
CATHERINE WAS AN ASPIRING
ACTRESS WHO WENT OFF HER
PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS

1538437576633
1568
WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT
WITH HER DAUGHTER.

1538437578301
3937
SHE HAD A MINOR PART
IN ""THE MERRY WIVES
OF WINDSOR"" 16 YEARS AGO

1538437582338
2269
WHEN SHE BECAME
FLORIDLY PSYCHOTIC.

1538437584707
2636
SHE WAS CONVINCED
THE OTHER ACTRESSES
WERE THE DEVIL’S WIVES,

1538437587443
1602
SO SHE STABBED ONE OF THEM.

1538437589145
1602
JJ: IS THAT WHEN
SHE WAS ADMITTED HERE?

1538437590846
2769
NOT YET. IT SEEMS
SHE HAD A SON
AND A DAUGHTER.

1538437593716
1201
AFTER FLEEING
THE THEATER,

1538437595017
2870
SHE CHOPPED OFF
THE LEFT ARM
OF HER INFANT DAUGHTER.

1538437597987
2035
Gassman:
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

1538437600122
3003
TO MAKE THE CHILD
LESS APPEALING
TO THE DEVIL.

1538437603225
3237
SHE BELIEVED THAT
KILLING THE DEVIL’S WIVES
WAS HER MISSION ON EARTH,

1538437606562
2135
WHICH IS WHAT
OUR UNSUB IS DOING NOW.

1538437608797
1969
BUT SHE DIED
IN THE ASYLUM FIRE.

1538437610866
3303
SOMEONE ELSE MUST BE
CARRYING OUT HER MISSION.

1538437622277

I MURDERED AN INNOCENT.

WHO WILL?

1538437641897
1969
NO ONE.

1538437645134

I’ve struggled
with bipolar

depression for years.

1538437794115
1568
I wasn’t happy
with myself

1538437795717

and I missed so much.

1538437797352
1335
Not being there
for the ones I love

1538437798720
1168
was hard.

1538437799921
2102
It made me really sad.

1538437802057
1969
So I talked to my doctor.

1538437804059
1869
She prescribed LATUDA.

1538437805961
1268
LATUDA is the number one

We’re going to Final Jeopardy!,

1538437919994

with this category now in play
for the three of you--

1538437922430
2202
World Literature.

To most, he‘s Phil Mickelson,
pro golfer.

1538437929503
2636
To me, he‘s,
well, dad.

1538437932139
2336
So when his joint pain
from psoriatic arthritis

1538437934475
2369
got really bad, it scared
me.

1538437936844
1568
And what could that pain
mean?

1538437938412
2402
Joint pain could mean
joint damage.

1538437940814
2135
ENBREL helps
relieve joint pain,

1538437942950
2135
helps stop irreversible
joint damage

1538437945086
2102
and helps skin get clearer.

1538437947188
2669
ENBREL may lower your
ability to fight infections.

1538437949857
1602
Serious sometimes
fatal events

1538437951459
2803
including infections,
tuberculosis, lymphoma,

1538437954261
2236
other cancers, nervous
system and blood disorders

1538437956497
1869
and allergic reactions
have occurred.

1538437958365
1635
Tell your doctor if
you‘ve been some place

1538437960000
1368
where fungal
infections are common,

1538437961368
1802
or if you‘re prone to
infections,

1538437963170
2636
have cuts or sores,
have had hepatitis B,

1538437965806
1335
have been treated for
heart failure,

1538437967140
1502
or if you have
persistent fever,

1538437968642
1802
bruising, bleeding,
or paleness.

1538437970444
901
Don‘t start ENBREL

1538437971345
1668
if you have an
infection like the flu.

1538437973013

Visit Enbrel.com

Ask about ENBREL.

1538437982656
3871
ENBREL. FDA approved
for over 16 years.

1538437987428
1201
No matter how much you clean,

1538437988662
2302
does your house still smell
stuffy?

1538437990998
1502
That’s because your home is
filled

1538437992533
1869
with soft surfaces that trap
odors

1538437994435
2002
and release them back into the
room.

1538437996470
2603
So, try Febreze Fabric
Refresher.

1538437999106
2102
Febreze finds odors trapped in
fabrics

1538438001241
2069
and cleans them away as it
dries.

1538438003343
2469
Use Febreze every time you tidy
up

1538438005846
2636
to keep your whole house
smelling fresh air clean.

1538438008515
2336
Fabric Refresher even works for
clothes you want

1538438010884
1535
to wear another day.

1538438012453
2336
Make Febreze part of your clean
routine

1538438014822
1335
for whole home freshness.

1538438018159
1301
We’ll be back

But Prop 127 is our chance

to break the cycle

1538437794193

of higher fees
and rates,

1538437795361
2469
using clean,
affordable energy.

1538437797830

And that‘s exactly why a utility

1538437799332
1802
like APS is fighting it.

1538437801133
2536
127 pulls the plug on
their racket

1538437803669
1935
and saves Arizona four billion

1538437805605
1768
dollars by tapping into

1538437807373

the power of the Arizona sun.

you need healthy skin.

Cetaphil is clinically shown to
strengthen the skin’s barrier

1538437545079
2703
and protect even the most

1538437547815

Managing my type 2 diabetes
wasn’t my top priority.

I found my Tresiba® Reason.

1538437558525
2236
Now I’m doing more
to lower my A1C.

1538437560794
3303
Once daily Tresiba® controls
blood sugar for 24 hours

1538437564131
1835
for powerful A1C reduction.

1538437565999
1568
Tresiba® is
a long-acting insulin

1538437567601
2703
used to control high blood sugar
in adults with diabetes.

1538437570337
2503
Don’t use Tresiba® to treat
diabetic ketoacidosis,

1538437572873
1368
during episodes of
low blood sugar,

1538437574275
2302
or if you are allergic to
any of its ingredients.

1538437576610
1535
Don’t share needles
or insulin pens.

1538437578179
1301
Don’t reuse needles.

1538437579513
1401
The most common side effect
is low blood sugar,

1538437580948
1602
which may cause
dizziness, sweating,

1538437582583
1435
confusion, and headache.

1538437584051
1068
Check your blood sugar.

1538437585152
1101
Low blood sugar can be serious

1538437586287
1068
and may be life-threatening.

1538437587388
1502
Injection site reactions
may occur.

1538437588923
1768
Tell your prescriber about
all medicines you take

1538437590725
1235
and all your medical conditions.

1538437591993
1768
Taking TZDs with insulins
like Tresiba®

1538437593794
2069
may cause serious side effects
like heart failure.

1538437595896
1168
Your insulin dose
shouldn’t be changed

1538437597097
1401
without asking your prescriber.

1538437598532

Get medical help right away

1538437870959

My girl La’Britney,

1538437872461
1168
she got it going on.

1538437873629
1001
She got a single coming out.

1538437874630

’Cause she’s what’s up.

1538437875631
1568
So, I have,
I have a single out

1538437877199
1335
called ""Actin’ Funny.""
Yeah.

1538437878534
2135
It’s now featuring Kash Doll,
and I just did a remix

1538437880669
1869
where I put Lady LeShurr
on it as well.

1538437882538
1802
It’s called
the ""Actin’ Funny Fe-mix.""

1538437884339
1235
Mm-hmm.
And I’ve been wanting

1538437885574
2402
to, you know, like spread
my music out here in the UK,

1538437887976

1538437889112

Uh...

1538437896519

someone called you ""sir""?

1538437731279
1702
Sixth grade,

1538437732981
2603
but I wore a sport coat
and carried a briefcase, so...

1538437736785
2803
Can you believe
when I met you I was 22?

1538437739588
1902
(laughs)
I mean, it’s crazy!

1538437741490
1635
Where did all that time go?

1538437743125
4071
Mm, you watched
The Bachelor a lot.

1538437747196
1835
Yeah, go ahead and make jokes,

1538437749031
1635
but your thirties
are almost over.

1538437750666
1502
No, they’re not.

1538437752167
1935
You’re closer to 40
than you are 30.

1538437754102
3570
Ha, ha! You married
an old man.

1538437757672
1935
Tell you what.

1538437759607
1368
Let’s do something
fun tonight.

1538437760975
1535
Won’t make us any younger.

1538437762510
2503
Well, maybe not, but some
day we actually will be old,

1538437765013
1869
and we’ll look
back on this night

1538437766882
2169
and remember what
a good time we had.

1538437769050
2002
Okay, like what?

1538437771052
3036
I know. Food fight!

1538437779527
2603
I’ll keep thinking.

1538437784365
3537
Look, I know you both feel bad
about being alone, but sometimes

1538437787902
3403
the best thing you can do is
take a little time for yourself,

1538437791305
2436
especially when you just
got out of a relationship.

1538437793741
2269
Speaking of ending
relationships,

1538437796010
4371
when British Honduras
became Belize,

1538437800381
2769
they designed a new flag
with a tree on it,

1538437803151
3971
and I would like to hang
myself from that tree.

1538437811492
2769
But, Amy,
when you and Sheldon split up,

1538437814262
2269
didn’t you start dating someone
right away?

1538437816531
2569
Well, I... I wouldn’t
say right away.

1538437819100
2970
And actually, it was
three different men.

1538437822070
1869
KRIPKE:
Three different men?!

1538437823938
4771
Damn, girl,
way to give the milk away?

1538437828710
2569
Oh, looks like
we just lost Kripke.

1538437831279
3170
Actually, I’m still here.

1538437834449
2069
Now?
Yup.

1538437836518
1835
Now?
Yup!

1538437838353
2002
Now?

1538437840355
3504
Oh, looks like
we just lost Kripke.

1538437843859
1935
Before Emily,
I was alone for so long.

1538437845794
2569
I just... I don’t know
if I can do that again.

1538437848363
1435
Well, you know,
here is something

1538437849798
1602
that might cheer you up.

1538437851399
3837
The flag of the Isle of Man
is nothing but three legs

1538437855236
3303
sharing a weird pair
of underpants, so...

1538437858540
2202
you think you
got problems.

1538437862310
2002
I have an idea.

1538437864312
1635
Maybe someone in our audience

1538437865947
1969
would be interested
in meeting Rajesh.

1538437867916
2002
Ladies, I can attest

1538437869918
1902
that he is a kind,
handsome, intelligent...

1538437880595

Oh. Well, that was quick.

2503
Hi. You’re on
Fun with Flags.

1538437886401
2202
KRIPKE:
Hey, I think I got cut off.

1538437891272
1502
Hello, Kripke.

1538437892774
2169
I have a flag question.

1538437894943
3203
How many men
did you have sex with?

1538437899414
3270
Let’s see.
What’s young and fun?

1538437902684
1935
Uh, we could
go dancing.

1538437904619
1568
Are you actually
gonna dance?

1538437906187
1068
Of course.
Yeah.

1538437907255
1935
No one wants to see that.

1538437909191
2503
Hey, how about skinny dipping
at the beach?

1538437911693
3070
No, I don’t need
any fish nibbling my business.

1538437916631
2035
Oh, there’s a screening
of Moulin Rouge!

1538437918667
1602
I heard the crowd
sings along and stuff.

1538437920268
1935
That sounds fun.
When’s it start?

1538437922204
1835
Midnight.

1538437924039
1635
Midnight. Really?

1538437925674
1869
You know what? Let’s do it.

1538437927542
1568
Okay, great!

1538437930211
2436
Oh, wait. Uh, it’s sold out.

1538437932647
2302
Oh, thank God.
Yes!

1538437936050
2336
It says, rabies
in rabbits is

1538437938386
1268
highly unlikely.

1538437939654
2035
Oh, terrific.
It’s not terrific.

1538437941690
1802
Lots of highly unlikely
things happen.

1538437943491
3737
You saw what’s under this robe,
and you still married me.

1538437947228
2135
If you’re really worried,
we’ll take him to the vet

1538437950699
2302
Thank you. Oh, okay,
there is a test!

1538437953001
2002
All they have to do is...

1538437955003
2035
cut off his head
and check his brain.

1538437957038
2102
Oh, cut off his head?

1538437959140
3737
That’s where
his little nose is.

1538437962877
3337
He’s not showing
any symptoms.

1538437966214
3804
I guess I’ll just go to the
emergency room to be safe.

1538437970018
2302
Howie, this is just
your hypochondria.

1538437972320
1935
No, when I sat
on the mute button

1538437974256
2569
and thought I’d gone deaf,
that was my hypochondria.

1538437985367
3170
We’ll find another time
to tell him I’m pregnant.

1538437995110
2135
KOOTHRAPPALI:
I mean, this is the first time

1538437997245
1869
I’ve ever broken up
with someone.

1538437999114
3103
I just... I didn’t realize
it was gonna hurt this much.

1538438002216
1969
It really can.

1538438004185
2069
All right.

1538438007622
2903
Nothing about
this is fun.

1538438010525
2769
No one wants to
talk about flags,

1538438013294
3504
and I haven’t spoken
in over ten minutes,

1538438016798
3303
so, enjoy your
new show, Internet.

I’m sorry for bothering you.

1538438029377
1401
I’ll hang up now.

1538438030778
1502
No, hold on, Rajesh.

1538438032280
1935
You know, you’re not being
very sympathetic.

1538438034215
2169
You know firsthand
that breakups are hard.

1538438036384
2402
Fine.

1538438038786
2636
If youou insist on makin
me a part of this,

1538438041422
2369
yes, I knowledge how
painful they can be.

1538438043791
4605
However, pain has an
evolutionary purpose.

1538438048396
2870
It provides information
from the environment

1538438051265
2536
that, uh, behavior
isn’t good for us.

1538438053801
2603
KRIPKE:
Like when I fell in love
with that stripper

1538438056404
2069
and bought h a Prius.

1538438060508
2402
I’m just gonna push
all the buttons.

1538438064746
2736
Raj, now, I’m sorry
you’re suffering.

1538438067482
3270
When Amy and I were
broken up, I also suffered.

1538438070752
2336
And this may
sound surprising,

1538438073087
2436
but I’m grateful for
having gone through it.

1538438075523
2035
Really?

1538438077558
1969
Yes.

1538438079527
4438
I believe our relationship
now is stronger than ever.

1538438083965
2569
So do I.

1538438086534
1435
When-when we were apart,

1538438087969
2202
I learnened how importan
you are to me.

1538438090171
2102
And I realize

1538438092273
2569
that when two people are
in love, sometimes they...

of stuff?

1538437622886
1068
I‘ll tell you why.

1538437624004

Because you‘ve always
got an angle.

why this holiday makes
your mother so crazy?

‘Cause she‘s crazy?

1538437915078

For sure,
but there‘s a reason

1538437917114
1802
why this day means
so much to her.

1538437918950
2503
Because she always made
dinner with nana.

1538437921485
1502
Well,
what you don‘t know is

1538437923020

1535
I‘m a liar.

1538437977774

It was totally unfounded.

would look like,

1538437513766

right there, you know,

1538437522541

This is what I’ve been searching
for, a Maya pyramid, seven
stories high

1538437570923

until the LiDAR survey.

1538437578330
5239
It’s just one of an incredible
65,000 new features that have
been revealed.

1538437585904
2636
It’s simply mind-boggling.

1538437590275
4037
Just trekking out to one of
them today, tells me that it’s
going to take generations

1538437594379
3370
of scientific effort, to be able
to fully explore them all.

1538437601253
4938
We just followed a map, created
by lasers in the sky, using
a helicopter to get into

1538437606258
11478
the jungle and then
bushwhacked for hours to
this point, to find this.

1538437617802
4271
A group of people, they put
their blood, their sweat, their
tears and possibly their lives

1538437622140
4004
into the creation
of this pyramid.

1538437626211
5105
But, even though this
building was completely
unknown to archaeologists,

1538437631416
4505
it’s clear that someone
has been here before.

1538437636021

1538437637990
3971
It’s obviously, been looted,

1538437642027
2102
but they don’t
really get it all.

1538437644229
3770
It’s the archaeologists that
come in and tell the real story.

1538437654072

what this pyramid is doing here
at all, in such a remote place.

And listen for a change.

1538437939024
2970
ALBERT: For decades, almost
everything we know about the
Maya has come from studying

1538437942060
5539
a handful of their seemingly
isolated cities and the remains
that have been found within them

1538437950468
6006
But the LiDAR project is
giving archaeologists a vast
map of not only these cities,

1538437956541
2269
but of everything
that lies between.

1538437960579
2603
And that’s throwing
up some big surprises.

1538437964216
3604
Francisco’s pyramid
is one of the biggest.

1538437967885
3904
ALBERT: You didn’t know this
existed before the LiDAR?
FRANCISCO: No, no...

1538437971856
4471
ALBERT: Because he believes it
could be a watchtower.

1538437976394
4872
And that would support a new and
radical idea about Maya warfare.

1538437983067
2669
ALBERT: Does the data show you
that they were fighting more
than we thought before, or?

1538437985803
3070
FRANCISCO: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Way more than we thought.

1538437991308
4104
ALBERT: Before the new LiDAR
survey, archaeologists found
little evidence of large scale

1538437995479
2703
Maya fighting at all.

1538437998216
5305
It was believed that wars were
resolved through the ritual
capture and sacrifice of kings

1538438003622
2636
and enemies.

1538438006324
2135
But that’s suddenly changing.

1538438010662
4137
Because the LiDAR
is showing up defences and
fortifications everywhere.

1538438016167
5939
TOM: The whole ridge
is fortified, they are
protecting themselves here.

1538438022173
5606
ALBERT: 12 miles to the west of
Tikal, an immense and previously
unknown fortress perched

1538438027879
1869
on a steep escarpment.

1538438031183
3637
TOM: This was a self-sustaining
fortress, they were ready to be
under siege here

1538438034886
2402
and we had no idea
any of this existed.

1538438040659
3837
ALBERT: There even seems to be
a colossal earth work
surrounding the mighty city

1538438044596
868
of Tikal itself.

1538438048633
2603
FRANCISCO: This is like
the great wall of Tikal.

1538438051336
1568
ALBERT: That’s incredible.

1538438052971
4371
Up to 15 feet high and thought
to be more than ten miles long,

1538438057442
3170
the wall is far more than an
indication of Maya conflict,

1538438060712
5305
but also evidence of the ability
of the Maya to tame the jungle
around them.

1538438067218
2202
On a massive scale.

1538438072523
4638
Across what was thought to be
jungle wilderness, the LiDAR
team is discovering

1538438077228
5372
the sheer extent and complexity
of Maya civilization for the
very first time.

1538438086537
5072
It’s always been astounding to
think the May could sustain such
great cities in the jungle.

1538438094679
3604
But no one imaged that the
space between the cities

1538438098350
3670
could possibly have
been so heavily populated.

1538438102087
3470
FRANCISCO: These squares, these
are all masonry buildings.

1538438105623
4905
TOM: You can just see when
you peel the jungle off,
look, it’s just everywhere.

1538438110595
7374
ALBERT: So far, more than
60,000 previously unknown
buildings have been counted.

1538438118035
4471
TOM: You get a sense of how
much is out there, I mean, it
seems like this whole zone

1538438122573
4438
was covered in human
activity, the whole jungle.

1538438127078
6440
ALBERT: What we thought were
whole cities were really
only the city centres.

1538438133584
5405
Now, we can see a vast urban
sprawl, spread into the jungle.

1538438140958
3704
TOM: This site, El
Palmer, is 40 times bigger
than we thought it was.

1538438144762
1635
ALBERT: 40 times bigger?
TOM: Yeah.

1538438150134
4838
ALBERT: It’s leading to overall
population estimates for the
Maya world that are almost

1538438155072
2469
beyond belief.

1538438157642
3637
How many people did they
originally think existed
in the Maya world?

1538438161346
4104
FRANCISCO: People
estimated maybe there
was one, two million.

1538438165483
5839
ALBERT: The team are now
estimating that figure could
be up to 20 million people.

1538438171422
7975
(music)

1538438179464
5539
It’s a number around half the
entire population of Europe
at the time, in an area,

2703
one 30th the size.

1538438195380
4671
For decades, the dense
jungle has tricked everyone.

1538438200118

cities were isolated.

that that’s simply wrong.

Looking at the swampy valley
around Holmul, Francisco sees
evidence of agriculture

1538438227979
2836
on an astonishing scale.

1538438230882
4671
FRANCISCO: Those are channels,
there’s like a huge grid all
over this place

1538438235653
2703
and it goes out 20
kilometers to the north.

1538438238455
3837
Every inch of this
wetland is cultivated.

1538438242359
4204
(music)

1538438246664
3136
ALBERT: Thousands of acres,
drained and irrigated

1538438249867
3670
and converted into
a fertile breadbasket,
that could supply food,

1538438253604
4137
not only for Holmul, but for
the entire region around Tikal.

1538438260444
3370
This whole thing would be
farms, like the central
valley of California?

1538438263914
1134
FRANCISCO: Yes.

1538438265150
6139
(music)

1538438271356
3637
ALBERT: And on a scale
far greater than anyone
ever thought before,

1538438275059
5572
networks of highways
run through the jungle,
connecting the cities.

1538438280731
1768
So, these are causeways then?

1538438282566
4104
TOM: Yeah, the LiDAR, with the
ability to remove the jungle,
shows these are all over

1538438286738
4171
the place and they’re connecting
cities over vast distances.

1538438290975
4037
ALBERT: The Maya, across
the entire Peten had a
network of super highways?

1538438295113
2202
FRANCISCO: Yes.

1538438297381
4037
ALBERT: The LiDAR is revealing
an engineered and managed
landscape.

1538438304021
4371
With specialized areas of
agriculture, able to supply
the cities with food,

1538438308459
5072
for a simply massive population
on an almost industrial scale.

1538438314966
7307
This is all a completely
new story, being told for the
first time, through the LiDAR.

1538438326677
5038
The Maya have always been
considered one of the great
civilizations of the Americas.

This is amazing.

1538437828443

With moderate to severe
ulcerative colitis,

1538437830345
1068
Are you okay?

1538437831446
3437
even when I was there,

1538437834917
1502
I never knew when my symptoms

1538437836452
3804
would keep us apart.

1538437840289
2135
So I talked to my doctor
about HUMIRA.

1538437842458
1368
I learned HUMIRA can help get,

1538437843859
1568
and keep UC under control

1538437845461
2369
when other medications haven’t
worked well enough.

1538437847863
2236
And it helps people achieve
control that lasts.

1538437850132
1201
So you can experience few

1538437851367
1134
or no symptoms.

1538437852535
2135
HUMIRA can lower your ability
to fight infections,

1538437854703
1268
including tuberculosis.

1538437856004
2135
Serious, sometimes fatal
infections and cancers,

1538437858173
1702
including lymphoma, have
happened;

1538437859908
2336
as have blood, liver, and
nervous system problems,

1538437862277
3003
serious allergic reactions, and
new or worsening heart failure.

1538437865314
2035
Before treatment,
get tested for TB.

1538437867382
1602
Tell your doctor if you’ve been
to areas

1538437869017
1802
where certain fungal infections
are common,

1538437870852
1101
and if you’ve had TB,

1538437871987
868
hepatitis B,

1538437872888
1168
are prone to infections,

1538437874089
1735
or have flu-like symptoms
or sores.

1538437875858
2236
Don’t start HUMIRA if you have
an infection.

1538437878127
1768
Be there for you, and them.

1538437879929
2503
Ask your gastroenterologist
about HUMIRA.

1538437882464
2102
With HUMIRA,
control is possible.

1538437906836
2569
Oh, looks like
we just lost Kripke.

1538437909406
3170
Actually, I’m still here.

1538437912576
2069
Now?
Yup.

1538437914644
1835
Now?
Yup!

1538437916479
2002
Now?

1538437918481
3504
Oh, looks like
we just lost Kripke.

1538437921985
1935
Before Emily,
I was alone for so long.

1538437923920
2569
I just... I don’t know
if I can do that again.

1538437926489
1435
Well, you know,
here is something

1538437927924
1602
that might cheer you up.

1538437929526
3837
The flag of the Isle of Man
is nothing but three legs

1538437933363
3303
sharing a weird pair
of underpants, so...

1538437936666
2169
you think you
got problems.

1538437940436
2002
I have an idea.

1538437942438
1635
Maybe someone in our audience

1538437944073
1969
would be interested
in meeting Rajesh.

1538437946042
2002
Ladies, I can attest

1538437948044
1902
that he is a kind,
handsome, intelligent...

1538437949946
2503
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Rich parents!
Don’t forget, rich parents!

1538437954717
2469
...spoiled astrophysicist
who not only...

1538437957186
1535
(phone ringing)

1538437958721
3303
Oh. Well, that was quick.

1538437962025
2503
Hi. You’re on
Fun with Flags.

1538437964527
1935
KRIPKE:
Hey, I think I got cut off.

1538437969399
1502
Hello, Kripke.

1538437970900
2169
I have a flag question.

1538437973069
3003
How many men
did you have sex with?

1538437977540
3270
Let’s see.
What’s young and fun?

1538437980810
1935
Uh, we could
go dancing.

1538437982746
1568
Are you actually
gonna dance?

1538437984314
1068
Of course.
Yeah.

1538437985382
1935
No one wants to see that.

1538437987317
2503
Hey, how about skinny dipping
at the beach?

1538437989819
3070
No, I don’t need
any fish nibbling my business.

1538437994757
2035
Oh, there’s a screening
of Moulin Rouge!

1538437996793
1602
I heard the crowd
sings along and stuff.

1538437998394
1935
That sounds fun.
When’s it start?

1538438000329
1835
Midnight.

1538438002165
1635
Midnight. Really?

1538438003800
1869
You know what? Let’s do it.

1538438005669
1235
Okay, great!

1538438008338
2436
Oh, wait. Uh, it’s sold out.

1538438010774
2135
Oh, thank God.
Yes!

1538438014177
2336
It says, rabies
in rabbits is

1538438016513
1268
highly unlikely.

1538438017781
2035
Oh, terrific.
It’s not terrific.

1538438019816
1802
Lots of highly unlikely
things happen.

1538438021618
3737
You saw what’s under this robe,
and you still married me.

1538438025355
2135
If you’re really worried,
we’ll take him to the vet

1538438027490
1335
and have him tested.
Good.

1538438028825
2302
Thank you. Oh, okay,
there is a test!

1538438031127
2002
All they have to do is...

1538438033129
2035
cut off his head
and check his brain.

1538438035165
2102
Oh, cut off his head?

1538438037267
3737
That’s where
his little nose is.

1538438041004
3337
He’s not showing
any symptoms.

1538438044340
3804
I guess I’ll just go to the
emergency room to be safe.

1538438048144
2302
Howie, this is just
your hypochondria.

1538438050446
1935
No, when I sat
on the mute button

1538438052382
2569
and thought I’d gone deaf,
that was my hypochondria.

1538438063493
3070
We’ll find another time
to tell him I’m pregnant.

1538438073236
2135
KOOTHRAPPALI:
I mean, this is the first time

1538438075371
1869
I’ve ever broken up
with someone.

1538438077240
3103
I just... I didn’t realize
it was gonna hurt this much.

1538438080343
1969
It really can.

1538438082312
1869
All right.

1538438085748
2903
Nothing about
this is fun.

1538438088651
2769
No one wants to
talk about flags,

1538438091421
3504
and I haven’t spoken
in over ten minutes,

1538438094924
3303
so, enjoy your
new show, Internet.

1538438098228
4371
Dr. Amy Farrah Flower
Present... With.

1538438105401
2102
KOOTHRAPPALI:
I’m sorry for bothering you.

1538438107504
1401
I’ll hang up now.

1538438108905
1502
No, hold on, Rajesh.

1538438110406
1935
You know, you’re not being
very sympathetic.

1538438112342
2169
You know firsthand
that breakups are hard.

1538438114511
2369
Fine.

1538438116880
2669
If you insist on making
me a part of this,

1538438119549
2369
yes, I knowledge how
painful they can be.

1538438121918
4605
However, pain has an
evolutionary purpose.

1538438126523
2870
It provides information
from the environment

1538438129392
2536
that, uh, behavior
isn’t good for us.

1538438131928
2603
KRIPKE:
Like when I fell in love
with that stripper

1538438134531
1702
and bought her a Prius.

1538438138635
2402
I’m just gonna push
all the buttons.

1538438142872
2736
Raj, now, I’m sorry
you’re suffering.

1538438145608
3270
When Amy and I were
broken up, I also suffered.

1538438148878
2336
And this may
sound surprising,

1538438151214
2436
but I’m grateful for
having gone through it.

1538438153650
2002
Really?

1538438155652
1969
Yes.

1538438157620
4471
I believe our relationship
now is stronger than ever.

1538438162091
2569
So do I.

1538438164661
1401
When-when we were apart,

1538438166062
2236
I learned how important
you are to me.

1538438168298
2102
And I realize

1538438170400
2569
that when two people are
in love, sometimes they...

1538438172969
2269
BOTH:
Happy Valentine’s Day!

1538438175238
3770
(whooping)

1538438179008
2469
We are young and fun!

1538438181477
3604
(horn honking)

1538438186749
2035
I stand corrected.

1538438188785
2302
Fun.

1538438305668
2736
Congratulations on a
successful live show.

1538438308405
2669
And a lovely
Valentine’s Day.

1538438313176
4238
Cleaning up
is not young and fun.

1538438317413
2169
It can be.
Confetti fight!

1538438324788
2069
Maybe you should take a break.

1538438326856
1368
I got this.

1538438330960
5205
Did you know the singular
of confetti is ""confetto""?

1538438336165
3670
Interesting, and when
would you use the singular?

1538438339836
1301
I’m glad you asked.

1538438341137
2970
Amy, you have a
confetto in your nose.

1538438344107
4671
No, no, no, no.
Other side. There you go.

And if they find out,
then they’ll just know

1538437774312
2970
that everyone was right
about me being such a screw-up.

1538437777382
1668
I mean, how many months
along are you?

1538437779150
1101
Oh, all of them.

1538437780351
2402
Yeah, go ahead.
Condemn me.

1538437782854
4071
I can see the judgment all over
that generic face of yours.

1538437787025
3237
This strap is cutting
into me like a piano wire.

1538437790362
1768
Would you mind going through
my luggage

1538437792230
1602
and pulling out
my after-dinner bra?

1538437793932
1368
If I must.

Thanks for asking.

Mitchell and I

in the human/animal category.

1538437810081

- What are you doing?
- Self-comforting with food.

1538437814419
1468

on that all morning,

1538437815987

a party tonight.

1538437817422

gonna do with a cake

1538437819391

1538437821693

Okay, that’s it.

1538437823061
1935
Pam, you are rude.

1538437825097
1535
You are disrespectful.

1538437826732
1201
And you are going in
for another bite?!

1538437828033
2002
Put the fork down!
Put it down!

1538437830135
2669
It is high time
that you start thinking

1538437832904

about somebody
other than yourself!

1538437834906

Yes, it is.

Don’t. No!

1538437900672
3103
I wouldn’t look like

1538437903875

1538437905077

Oh, oh, here,

1538437910148
1702
Here you go. Come on.

1538437911950
3270
Okay, so they are gonna
be here in, uh, 10 minutes.

1538437915320
1168
I’ll never make it!

1538437916588
1235
Okay.
It’s a-coming!

1538437917923
1702
Okay!

1538437919724
934
It’s all right.
We’re here for you.

1538437920759
1335
Help me get her pants off.

1538437922194
1134
- Okay. Yes.
- All right, we need to get

1538437923428

some pillows
up underneath her hips

1538437924529
1702

properly angled.

Frank and Lorraine,
today marks the public and legal

1538437937042
2870
joining of your souls,
marriage being above all else,

1538437940011
901
a contract.

1538437941012
1935
(coughs)

1538437943048
2436
Uh, one of my
favorite authors once wrote,

1538437945584
2035
""If love is not all,
then it is nothing.

1538437947719
2503
This principle,
and its opposite,

1538437950322
3170
collide down all the years of --
of my breathless tale.""

1538437953592
1435
(yawns)

1538437955127
3270
Seeing Phil bomb up there,
I felt like a mama bird

1538437958497
1802
who had just nudged her chick
out of the nest

1538437960399
2102
without a single pun
to break his fall.

1538437962601
3804
""For man can no more
survive without love

1538437966504
2069
than a cooper
without his billhook,

1538437968673
2903
nor a whaler less
his flensing knife.""

1538437971676
1301
Words as true today
as they were

1538437973077
1702
when they were written
18,000 years ago.

1538437974879
1802
That can’t be right.

1538437976781
2135
Now is the moment
when I ask if anyone here

1538437979016
3403
has reason to object to
the union of these two people.

1538437982520
934
Thank you.

1538437983554
1301
I object!

1538437984956
2803
I object to you not handing over
those diamond rings, preacher!

1538437987859
1535
(as gangster)
You heard her.

1538437989494
2669
Hand over the ice,
or I fill you full of...leed.

1538437992263
1668
- Lead.
- Honey, what are you doing?

1538437994032
2169
Sorry,  padre,
you had your chance.

1538437996301
1335
I now pronounce you dead!

1538437997736

(scattered gasps)

1538437999137

These twos is

1538438007345

Mind your own potatoes,
Daisy.

1538438009313
2069
- Ohh!
- Excuse me.

1538438011482
2703
This is my wedding
and your funeral!

1538438014285
2769
- Ohh!
- And one for the choir boy!

1538438017155

should let Pam and the baby

1538438037109
1735
stay upstairs
for a little while.

1538438038944

No, he hates when I do that.

3737
- Ah!
-  ...if we’re lucky,

1538438058764

worth taking.

And with that,

1538437892656
2703
we wrap up
this Double Jeopardy! round.

1538437895425
1602
We’re going to Final Jeopardy!,
gentlemen,

1538437897093
2369
with this category now in play
for the three of you--

1538437899529
2202
World Literature.
Think about it. Make a wager.

1538437901798
1435
Back in a moment.

1538437903233

To most, he‘s Phil Mickelson,
pro golfer.

1538437906603
2636
To me, he‘s,
well, dad.

1538437909239
2336
So when his joint pain
from psoriatic arthritis

1538437911575
2369
got really bad, it scared
me.

1538437913944
1568
And what could that pain
mean?

1538437915512
2402
Joint pain could mean
joint damage.

1538437917914
2135
ENBREL helps
relieve joint pain,

1538437920050
2135
helps stop irreversible
joint damage

1538437922185
2102
and helps skin get clearer.

1538437924287
2669
ENBREL may lower your
ability to fight infections.

1538437926957
1602
Serious sometimes
fatal events

1538437928558
2803
including infections,
tuberculosis, lymphoma,

1538437931361
2236
other cancers, nervous
system and blood disorders

1538437933596
1869
and allergic reactions
have occurred.

1538437935465
1635
Tell your doctor if
you‘ve been some place

1538437937100
1368
where fungal
infections are common,

1538437938468
1802
or if you‘re prone to
infections,

1538437940270
2636
have cuts or sores,
have had hepatitis B,

1538437942906
1335
have been treated for
heart failure,

1538437944241
1502
or if you have
persistent fever,

1538437945743
1802
bruising, bleeding,
or paleness.

1538437947544
901
Don‘t start ENBREL

1538437948445
1668
if you have an
infection like the flu.

1538437950114
3337
Since ENBREL, dad‘s
back to being dad.

1538437953449
1435
Visit Enbrel.com

1538437954884
1034
and use the Joint
Damage Simulator

1538437955918
2836
to see how your joint damage
could be progressing.

1538437958755
968
Ask about ENBREL.

1538437959722
3904
ENBREL. FDA approved
for over 16 years.

1538437964527
1201
No matter how much you clean,

1538437965762
2302
does your house still smell
stuffy?

1538437968097
1502
That’s because your home is
filled

1538437969632
1869
with soft surfaces that trap
odors

1538437971534
2002
and release them back into the
room.

1538437973570
2603
So, try Febreze Fabric
Refresher.

1538437976206
2102
Febreze finds odors trapped in
fabrics

1538437978341
2069
and cleans them away as it
dries.

1538437980443
2469
Use Febreze every time you tidy
up

1538437982946
2636
to keep your whole house
smelling fresh air clean.

1538437985615
2336
Fabric Refresher even works for
clothes you want

1538437987984
1535
to wear another day.

1538437989552
2336
Make Febreze part of your clean
routine

1538437991921
1335
for whole home freshness.

1538437995258
1301
We’ll be back
with Final Jeopardy!

2569
HE RAN OUT OF PATIENCE.

1538437772538
2236
WHILE THE RAMPARTS SEEM
MIGHTY ENOUGH,

1538437774840
2903
MOATS ADDED TO THE FORTIFIED
CITY’S DEFENSES.

1538437777809
2503
WHILE NOT REALLY FILLED
WITH WATER AND ALLIGATORS,

1538437780379
3003
MOATS WERE GENERALLY JUST
A DANGEROUS NO-MAN’S LAND,

1538437783415
1668
DESIGNED TO EXPOSE ATTACKERS.

1538437785150
2703
SMALL, SQUARE HOLES
ON THE INNER WALL

1538437787920
2402
ONCE SUPPORTED TIMBERS,
WHICH SUPPORTED

1538437790389
2336
DEFENSIVE WALKWAYS.

1538437792791
1835
MODERN SHOPS FILL BUILDINGS

1538437794693
3003
THAT DATE FROM CARCASSONNE’S
GOLDEN AGE --

1538437797763
1869
THE 1100s --

1538437799698
2803
WHEN TROUBADOURS SANG BALLADS
OF IDEAL LOVE,

1538437802568
1401
CHIVALRY WAS IN VOGUE,

1538437804036
1401
AND A PRAGMATIC SPIRIT

1538437805504
2636
OF TOLERANCE
PERVADED EVERYTHING.

1538437814446
2102
THIS BECAME A CENTER
OF THE CATHARS --

1538437816615
1735
A HERETICAL GROUP
OF CHRISTIANS

1538437818416
1168
WHO THRIVED AROUND HERE

1538437819651
2202
FROM THE 11th THROUGH THE 13th
CENTURIES.

1538437821886
1435
THEY SAW LIFE AS A BATTLE

1538437823388
1969
BETWEEN GOOD --
THE SPIRITUAL --

1538437825423
1401
AND BAD -- THE MATERIAL.

1538437826891
1969
TO THE CATHARS,
MATERIAL THINGS

1538437828927
1568
WERE EVIL AND OF THE DEVIL.

1538437830562
3203
AS FRANCE WAS WORKING TO
CONSOLIDATE ITS CENTRAL POWER,

1538437833832
2736
IT CLAMPED DOWN ON FEISTY
REGIONS LIKE THIS,

1538437836635
1969
ESPECIALLY IF THEY
WERE SYMPATHETIC

1538437838670
2102
TO HERETICAL GROUPS
LIKE THE CATHARS.

1538437840839
2236
THE REGION IS DOTTED
WITH EVOCATIVE

1538437843141
1502
AND REMOTE CASTLE RUINS,

1538437844676
2803
WHICH PROVIDED PLACES
OF DESPERATE LAST REFUGE

1538437847546
2603
FOR CATHARS
AND REMIND OF BLOODY STRUGGLES.

1538437850215
1301
WHEN DRIVEN OUT

1538437851583
3003
OF CARCASSONNE, MANY CATHARS
HID IN THE NEARBY CASTLES

1538437854653
2803
OF LASTOURS.

1538437857522
1568
BACK IN PARIS,
THE KING WANTED

1538437859157
1935
TO TIGHTEN HIS GRIP
ON SOUTHERN FRANCE.

1538437861159
2236
IN ROME, THE POPE NEEDED
TO MAKE IT CLEAR

1538437863461
2703
THERE WAS ONLY ONE
ACCEPTABLE FORM OF CHRISTIANITY,

1538437866231
934
AND IT WAS ROMAN.

1538437867232
1835
BOTH FOUND
SELF-SERVING REASONS

1538437869134
1235
TO WAGE A GENOCIDAL WAR

1538437870435
1401
AGAINST THE CATHAR PEOPLE,

1538437871903
3203
WHO NEVER AMOUNTED TO MORE THAN
10% OF THE LOCAL POPULATION.

1538437875173
3070
AFTER A TERRIBLE PERIOD
OF TORTURE AND MASS BURNINGS,

1538437878309
1568
THE CATHARS WERE WIPED OUT.

1538437879944
3537
IN 1321, THE LAST CATHAR
WAS BURNED.

1538437883548
3270
THE CATHARS WERE ALSO
CALLED ALBIGENSIANS,

1538437886885
2302
NAMED AFTER THIS NEARBY TOWN,
ALBI.

1538437891156
2236
ITS MASSIVE ROMAN CATHOLIC
CATHEDRAL

1538437893458
2469
WAS THE FINAL NAIL
IN THE CATHAR COFFIN.

1538437895994
2135
BIG AND BOLD, IT MADE
THE CHURCH’S

1538437898197
2836
ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY TOWARDS
HERETICAL THINKING

1538437901100
2035
PERFECTLY CLEAR.

1538437903235
2169
THE CATHEDRAL LOOKS LESS
LIKE A CHURCH

1538437905471
3303
AND MORE LIKE A FORTRESS
ON PURPOSE.

1538437911743
3770
THE INTERIOR LOOKS ESSENTIALLY
AS IT DID IN 1500,

1538437915580
2002
AND ITS ART COMES
WITH A STERN MESSAGE.

1538437917649
1468
IN THE LAST JUDGMENT PAINTING,

1538437919184
1602
THE DEAD
COME OUT OF THE GROUND

1538437920852
1735
WITH AN ACCOUNTING
OF THEIR DEEDS,

1538437922654
1869
BOTH GOOD AND BAD,
PRINTED IN LEDGERS

1538437924589
1068
THEIR CHESTS.

1538437925723
2803
THE SAVED LOOK CONFIDENT
AND COMFORTABLE.

1538437928593
1835
AND THOSE WHOSE LEDGERS
DON’T ADD UP

1538437930495
934
LOOK PRETTY NERVOUS.

1538437931496
1201
A WIDE SELECTION

1538437932730
2035
OF GRUESOME PUNISHMENTS
AWAITS THE SINNERS.

1538437934832
1134
THESE GRAPHIC SCENES

1538437936034
3136
WERE DESIGNED TO FRIGHTEN
WIDE-EYED PARISHIONERS

1538437939237
3937
INTO CONFORMITY
WITH CHURCH DICTATES.

1538437949314
1702
NEXT TO THE CHURCH,
THE FORMER HOME

1538437951083
1435
OF ALBI’S ARCHBISHOP
CONTAINS

1538437952584
1768
THE WORLD’S LARGEST
COLLECTION OF ART

1538437954419
1168
BY HENRI TOULOUSE-LAUTREC.

1538437955687
2769
THE MUSEUM DISPLAYS HIS WORK
CHRONOLOGICALLY,

1538437958523
2703
LETTING YOU FOLLOW
THE EVOLUTION OF HIS ART

1538437961293
1969
WITH HIS FASCINATING
LIFE STORY.

1538437963328
3003
TOULOUSE-LAUTREC, WHO WAS BORN
HERE IN ALBI IN 1864,

1538437966398
1768
WAS CRIPPLED
FROM HIS YOUTH.

1538437968233
2336
BECAUSE OF THIS, HE WAS
ON THE FRINGE OF SOCIETY,

1538437970635
2469
AND HE HAD AN AFFINITY
FOR PEOPLE WHO DIDN’T FIT IN.

1538437973171
3270
HE MADE HIS MARK
PAINTING THE PARISIAN UNDERCLASS

1538437976475
1635
WITH AN INTIMACY POSSIBLE

1538437978176
2369
ONLY BY SOMEONE
WITH HIS LIFE EXPERIENCE.

1538437980612
1468
HIS SUBJECTS
WERE FROM BARS,

1538437982147
2002
BROTHELS, AND CABARETS.

1538437984216
3904
HENRI WAS PARTICULARLY
FASCINATED BY CANCAN DANCERS,

1538437988153
3971
WHOSE LEGS MOVED WITH AN AGILITY
HE WOULD NEVER EXPERIENCE.

1538437994092
2736
IN THE 1890s,
HENRI FREQUENTED BROTHELS

1538437996862
2302
AND BEFRIENDED
MANY PROSTITUTES.

1538437999231
2803
HE RESPECTED THE WOMEN,
FEELING BOTH FASCINATION

1538438002100
1401
AND EMPATHY TOWARD THEM.

1538438003568
2336
THE PROSTITUTES
ACCEPTED HENRI

1538438005971
1168
JUST AS HE WAS.

1538438007205
2202
THEY ALLOWED HIM
INTO THEIR WORLD,

1538438009474
2169
AND HE SKETCHED
CANDID PORTRAITS.

1538438011710
3403
EVENTUALLY, TOULOUSE-LAUTREC
ESTABLISHED HIS UNIQUE STYLE.

1538438015180
1535
COLORS -- GARISH.

1538438016782
3070
SUBJECT MATTER --
HIDDEN WORLDS.

1538438019885
4438
MORALISM -- NONE.

1538438024389
1668
TOULOUSE-LAUTREC’S
ADVERTISING POSTERS

1538438026124
1101
WERE HIS BREAD AND BUTTER.

1538438027292
2135
HE WAS
AN INNOVATIVE ADVERTISER,

1538438029494
2669
CREATING SIMPLE, BOLD,
LITHOGRAPHIC IMAGES

1538438032230
2169
FOR POSTERS.

1538438034466
1268
POSTERS SUCH AS THIS ONE

1538438035800
1835
PROMOTING THE FAMOUS
MOULIN ROUGE

1538438037702
2436
ESTABLISHED HIS BUSINESS
REPUTATION IN PARIS.

1538438040171
5205
SUCCESSFUL AS HE WAS,
HIS CAREER WAS SHORT.

1538438045443
4004
TOULOUSE-LAUTREC HAD
A SELF-DESTRUCTIVE LIFESTYLE.

1538438049514
1401
HE DIED AT THE AGE OF 37,

1538438050982
2069
ALCOHOLIC, DEPRESSED,
AND PARANOID.

1538438053118
2069
HE WAS UNMOURNED
AND UNAPPRECIATED

1538438055253
1401
BY THE ART ESTABLISHMENT.

1538438056721
1969
BUT THANKFULLY, HIS MOTHER
AND A BEST FRIEND

1538438058757
1768
RECOGNIZED HIS GENIUS
AND SAVED HIS WORK.

1538438060592
2302
THEY OFFERED IT TO THE LOUVRE,
WHICH REFUSED.

1538438062961
1869
BUT IN 1922,
THE MAYOR OF ALBI

1538438064896
2469
ACCEPTED THE COLLECTION
AND HUNG IT HERE.

1538438067432
1401
A WISE MOVE.

1538438068900
3103
THIS CORNER OF FRANCE
OFFERS A PERFECT STORM

1538438072070
2169
OF COUNTRYSIDE EXPERIENCES --

1538438074305
1635
EVOCATIVE CASTLES,

1538438076007
1802
REALLY OLD ART,

ALL WITH A CHANCE
TO HIKE THROUGH HISTORY,

1538438081947

This became a center
of the Cathars,

1538438144576
1735
a heretical group
of Christians.

1538438146311

1538438174339

Like good travel,
public television

1538438178209

gets us out
of our comfort zone.

1538438180745
2302
It opens us up

LIKE A COLD
CREAM GUARD...

1068

1538437635257
1802
AND ERNEST T. CALLED
HIM AN ENGLISHTER

1538437637126
1768
AND TRIED TO FIGHT
HIM RIGHT THERE.

1538437638961
1068
TRIED TO FIGHT HIM?

1538437640095
1368
YEAH, ’CAUSE HE’S ENGLISH.

1538437641530
2336
WELL, ERNEST T. COULD KILL HIM.
DID THEY FIGHT?

1538437643932
1969
NO, BUT THE LAST THING
ERNEST T. SAID WAS

1538437645968
2269
IF HE’S IN TOWN TOMORROW,
HE’S GOING TO WHUP HIM.

1538437648304
2102
YOU THINK HE’LL GO
OR YOU THINK HE’LL STAY?

1538437650473

1538437696585
1168
HELLO, SHERIFF.

1538437697819
1802
WHAT’S ALL THIS STUFF
DOING ON YOUR BICYCLE?

1538437699688
1835
ARE YOU LEAVING
TOWN OR SOMETHING?

1538437701590
1535
WELL, IT HAD
OCCURRED TO ME

1538437703192
1835
BUT THERE’S BEEN
A CHANGE OF PLAN.

1538437705094
1168
I’M... I’M STAYING ON.

1538437706328
2002
WELL, I’M GLAD TO
HEAR THAT, MALCOLM.

1538437708364
2002
I MIGHT HAVE TO DO
A BIT OF FIGHTING

1538437710432
1502
BUT IT’S ALL IN A DAY’S WORK.

1538437712001
1268
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE, MALCOLM.

1538437713335
1735
I’LL TAKE CARE
OF ERNEST T. BASS.

1538437715137
2936
NO, PLEASE. WE’VE ALREADY
DISPATCHED A RUNNER TO THE HILLS

1538437718140
1735
INFORMING HIM THAT I’M STAYING.

1538437719942
1034
NOW, LISTEN...

1538437721043
1702
IF HE WANTS TO DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT

1538437722811
2636
I’M PREPARED TO GIVE HIM
SATISFACTION AT NOON TOMORROW.

1538437725514
1869
HE WANTS TO FIGHT
IN BACK OF THE GARAGE.

1538437727449
968
NO FIGHTING.

1538437728484
1735
NO FIGHTING.
NO, ANDY, PLEASE

1538437730285
2870
THIS WHOLE MATTER HAS BECOME
RATHER IMPORTANT TO ME.

1538437733222
1535
HE WANTS ME
TO TRAIN HIM.

1538437734823
1268
LISTEN, MALCOLM...

1538437736158
2469
WHY, WITH ALL MY CYCLING,
I’M AS FIT AS A FIDDLE.

1538437738694
3136
JUST NEED A LITTLE BRUSHING UP
ON ME TECHNIQUE, THAT’S ALL.

1538437741897

THE EQUIPMENT.

1538437743765
2102
YOU DON’T SEEM

GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

1538437747569
1134
ANDY...

1538437748770
2736
THERE COMES A TIME
WHEN A MAN HAS TO FIGHT

1538437751573
2903
AND IF REMAINING IN MAYBERRY
MEANS FIGHTING MR. BASS

1538437754543
1401
THAT IS IT.

1538437757446
1502
ERNEST T. WILL KILL HIM.

1538437759014
2703
I’LL TEACH MALCOLM
EVERYTHING I KNOW, ANDY.

1538437761784
3170
YOU KNOW, I USED TO BE A
BULLY WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.

1538437767156
1335
ERNEST T. WILL KILL HIM.

1538437776165
2402
ERNEST T.!

1538437779768
2202
ERNEST T. BASS!

1538437788877
3036
HEY, QUIT THROWING ROCKS,

1538437791981

1538437793983
1668
COME ON UP, SHERIFF!

1538437795718
3103
I THOUGHT IT WAS
THE WIDOW BRADSHAW.

1538437809498
1535
HOWDY, SHERIFF.

1538437811100
2536
I’M IN TRAINING FOR THE FIGHT.

1538437827382
2402
ERNEST T., I WANT YOU
TO CALL OFF THIS FIGHT.

1538437829852
2703
NOW, LOOK HERE, I AIN’T
A-CALLIN’ OFF NOTHIN’!

1538437832621
2936
THAT ENGLISHTER HAS JUST
ABOUT RUINED MY LIFE.

1538437835624
1869
IF BY ANY CHANCE
HE HAPPENS TO BE

1538437837559
2236
BEHIND THAT GARAGE
TOMORROW AT HIGH NOON--

1538437839862
3003
WHICH I DO DOUBT--
I’M GOING TO FLING
MYSELF AT HIM...

1538437842931
1768
ALL 112 BEAUTIFUL
POUNDS OF ME.

1538437844766
1301
NOW, LISTEN, ERNEST T....

1538437846135
1268
I ALREADY BEAT UP ON HIM

1538437847469
2002
HERE ON THIS BAG
FIVE TIMES ALREADY.

1538437849538
1335
ERNEST T., QUIT A MINUTE!

1538437850939
1401
SUPPOSE I WAS TO TELL YOU

1538437852407
2936
THAT I WOULD JUST THROW YOU
IN JAIL IF YOU DON’T BACK OFF.

1538437855410
1768
WOULDN’T MAKE ME
NO NEVER MIND.

1538437857246
2302
I LIKES A LITTLE HIGH
LIVING NOW AND AGAIN.

1538437859615
1401
YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE THIS

1538437861083
2870
BUT I HAPPEN TO BE
NOTHING BUT A LITTLE
OLD COUNTRY BOY.

1538437864019
1802
SO I’D HAVE SOME
SECOND THOUGHTS

1538437865888
1668
ABOUT CALLING OFF
THAT FIGHT.

1538437867623
1668
SEEING’S THE WAY
MALCOLM FEELS

1538437869358
1201
I DON’T SEE HOW I CAN.

1538437870592
1635
YOU’RE SWEET.

1538437872294
2669
SHERIFF, YOU ARE SWEET.

1538437878834
3136
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU ALL ARE HARD AT IT.

1538437882037
1201
HOW’S IT COMING?

1538437883304
1802
SMASHING,
JUST SMASHING.

1538437885173
1068
EH, GOOBER?

1538437886307
2703
OH, YEAH, MALCOLM,
UH, GOOD, REAL GOOD.

1538437889077
1969
YOU BETTER GO
SKIP SOME ROPE NOW.

1538437891112
1001
RIGHT.

1538437892180
1068
ANDY...

1538437894382
1902
HOW’S IT COMING?

1538437896351
1935
Goober:
THAT’S THE
WAY, MALCOLM.

1538437898353
1535
HE’S GOING TO GET KILLED.

1538437899954
2102
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE TEACHING HIM.

1538437902123
2202
I’D JUST AS SOON
TEACH MY GRANDMA.

1538437904393
2569
LOST A BIT OF ME RHYTHM.

1538437907029
2002
I’M AFRAID HE’S GOING
TO STRANGLE HIMSELF

1538437909097
1068
BEFORE THE FIGHT.

1538437910232
1201
UNTIE YOURSELF, MALCOLM.

1538437911500
1235
WORK ON THE PUNCHING BAG.

1538437912801
1668
HE’S GOING TO GET KILLED.

1538437923645
1635
WELL, ANDY, ALL I CAN SAY IS

1538437925347
1969
IF THIS FIGHT
GOES ON TOMORROW

1538437927382
1568
MALCOLM MAY NOT GET KILLED

1538437929017
2636
BUT HE’S SURE EVER MORE
GONNA GET BRUISED.

1538437932954
2736
IT’S A CRIME,
IT’S JUST A CRIME.

1538437935757
2202
I HOPE MALCOLM
DON’T SHOW UP.

1538437938026
934
YEAH.

1538437939027
1301
MAYBE HE WON’T.

1538437940395
1902
IT’D BE THE
BEST THING

1538437942331
1401
BUT... IT’S 12:00.

1538437943765
2836
MALCOLM, DON’T COME
THROUGH THAT GATE.

1538437946668
3036
PLEASE DON’T COME
THROUGH THAT GATE.

1538437955510
1602
GENTLEMEN.

1538437961182
2669
MALCOLM, I CAN’T LET YOU
GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

1538437963918
2369
STAND BACK. THE CHALLENGE
HAS BEEN MADE

1538437966321
1368
AND HAS BEEN ACCEPTED.

1538437972327
2169
MALCOLM, DO YOU REMEMBER
EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU?

1538437974563
1201
I THINK SO, YES.

1538437975830
2135
ALL RIGHT, NOW, THE MAIN THING
TO DO IS RETREAT

1538437978032
2269
AND KEEP RETREATING,
AND IF HE COMES NEAR YOU

1538437980368
2402
RETREAT SOME MORE...
AND KEEP YOUR FACE COVERED.

1538437982837
1235
KEEP EVERYTHING COVERED.

1538437984138
2469
JUST RETREAT
AND STAY COVERED.

1538437986674
3136
I BROUGHT THIS TOWEL
OVER FROM THE SHOP.

1538437989877
3670
I’D LIKE TO THROW IT IN
BEFORE THE FIGHT STARTS.

1538437993615
3136
UH... PAIN KILLERS.

1538438001889
2336
WRONG OR RIGHT,
I’M HERE TO FIGHT

1538438004292
2035
UNLESS YOU RUN AWAY WITH FRIGHT.

1538438006394
1702
AND IF YOU WONDER WHO I BE

1538438008163
2035
IT’S ME, IT’S ME, IT’S ERNEST T.

1538438010265
1268
( cackling )

1538438011600
1168
YEE!

1538438013868
1668
I’M GOING TO TELL
YOU ONE MORE TIME

1538438015570
1201
IF YOU GO THROUGH WITH THIS

1538438016838
1502
I’M GOING TO THROW
YOU IN JAIL.

1538438018406
1702
I DON’T CARE, SHERIFF.
I DON’T CARE.

1538438020174
1702
LIKE I JUST TOLD YOU,
I DO NOT CARE.

1538438021943
1835
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO FIGHT HIM?

1538438023845
3036
BECAUSE HE IS AN ENGLISHTER,
AND HENCE-- I HATES HIM.

1538438026948
2936
WHY DO YOU HATE
HIM BECAUSE HE’S
AN ENGLISHTER?

1538438029951
2402
BECAUSE I AM IRISH,
AND MY MOMMY TOLD ME

1538438032420
2736
AS AN IRISHMAN, I HAVE
TO HATE ALL ENGLISHTERS.

1538438035223
2703
NOW, I ALWAYS DO
WHAT MY MOMMY TELLS ME.

1538438037959
1768
’SIDES THAT, HE TOOK MY JOB

1538438039760
3737
AND HE RUINED MY MATRIMONIAL
PLANS WITH MY BELOVED ROMEENA.

1538438043564
1435
HENCE-- I HATES HIM.

1538438045066
3704
NOW, IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME,
I REQUIRES NOT TO SOIL MY VEST.

1538438050538
1768
( sighs )

1538438054008
1702
WHEN DO I SHAKE
HANDS WITH HIM?

1538438055776
1268
OH, YOU DON’T SHAKE HANDS.

1538438057112
1835
YOU JUST KEEP COVERED
AND RETREAT.

1538438059014
2002
WELL, YOU MIGHT
AS WELL GO AT IT

1538438061082
1301
HADN’T YOU, ERNEST T.?

1538438062450
1268
RIGHT.

1538438063785
2236
IT’S GOING TO BE FUN
SEEING TWO IRISHMEN FIGHTING.

1538438068223
2636
BEEN HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE
WITH MY HEARING LATELY.

1538438070925
1602
WHAT WAS THAT
YOU JUST SAID?

1538438072594

gonna dance?

1538437877440

1538437878507

at the beach?

1538437882945

No, I don’t need
any fish nibbling my business.

1538437887883

of Moulin Rouge!

1538437889918

sings along and stuff.

1538437893455

1538437901464

we’ll take him to the vet

1538437920616

1538437921950
2302
Thank you. Oh, okay,
there is a test!

1538437924253
2002
All they have to do is...

1538437926255
2035
cut off his head
and check his brain.

1538437928290
2102
Oh, cut off his head?

1538437930392

this is fun.

1538438005468

that breakups are hard.

1538438007637
2369

1538438010006
2669
If you insist on making
me a part of this,

1538438012675
2369
yes, I knowledge how
painful they can be.

1538438015044
4605
However, pain has an
evolutionary purpose.

1538438019649
2870
It provides information
from the environment

1538438022518
5138
that, uh, behavior
isn’t good for us.

1538438044340
2436
but I’m grateful for
having gone through it.

1538438046776
2002
Really?

1538438048778
1969
Yes.

1538438050746
4471
I believe our relationship
now is stronger than ever.

1538438055217
2569
So do I.

1538438057786
1401
When-when we were apart,

1538438059188
2236
I learned how important
you are to me.

1538438061423
2102
And I realize

1538438063526
2569
that when two people are
in love, sometimes they...

1538438066095
2269
BOTH:
Happy Valentine’s Day!

1538438068364

We are young and fun!

1538438074603
3604
(horn honking)

1538438079875
2035
I stand corrected.

1538438081911
2436
Fun.

THE FACT THAT TRUMP‘S DEPARTMENT
OF JUSTICE HAS REFUSED TO
DEFEND...

1538438092454
5873
THE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS
PROTECTION, IS A WAKE-UP CALL
FOR EVERY AMERICAN.

1538438098360
3403
BECAUSE IF THERE IS ONE THING WE
AS AMERICANS OUGHT TO AGREE
ON...

1538438101797
4238
IT‘S THAT IF A FAMILY HAS A KID
WITH A SERIOUS ILLNESS...

1538438106068
5105
NONE OF THAT SHOULD PREVENT THAT
PERSON OR THAT FAMILY FROM
GETTING HEALTH INSURANCE.

1538438111207
3770
AND THE FACT THAT THEY’ER GOING
AFTER THAT, IS UNBELIEVABLY
INFURIATING.

1538438115010
17885
I’M SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, AND I
APPROVE THIS MESSAGE.

1538438227856
2736
Congratulations on a
successful live show.

1538438230592
2669
And a lovely
Valentine’s Day.

Cleaning up
is not young and fun.

1538438239602
2169
It can be.
Confetti fight!

1538438246976
2069
Maybe you should take a break.

1538438249044
1368
I got this.

1538438253148
5205
Did you know the singular
of confetti is ""confetto""?

1538438258354
3670
Interesting, and when
would you use the singular?

1538438262024
1301
I’m glad you asked.

1538438263325
2970
Amy, you have a
confetto in your nose.

1538438266295
4671
No, no, no, no.
Other side. There you go.

Mississippi River and I know

1538437610913
934
Frank: 16, okay.

1538437611948
1068
Frank: Every once in a
while, we see one of

1538437613116
1235
these on the
Mississippi River.

1538437614450
1768
Usually they’re
Chris-Crafts, you know.

1538437616319
1335
I’d go up to Clear Lake,
Iowa, they have a big,

1538437617754
1168
huge wooden
boat show.

1538437619021
1668
Mike: Any, any wood boat
on the river stands out.

1538437620790
1635
Frank: But wood
takes maintenance.

1538437622525
1034
Mark: Right.

1538437623659
1068
Frank: You know, now this
one says it hasn’t been

1538437624827
2769
out since 1960, is that
probably correct?

1538437627697
968
Mark: That’s right.

1538437628764
1869
I think the... motor had
some bad valves in it.

1538437630733
868
Mike: Okay.

""boat"" stands for?

Mike: You haven’t ridden
in it since you were 4?

1538437641110
1134
Mark: No.

1538437642345
1502
Mark: Yeah my mom and dad
had a lot of fun on that boat,

1538437643946
1335
the years they
were in it.

1538437645381
1668

1502
Mike: It’s pretty
cool, Frank.

1538437658527
1735
Frank: I mean, it’s been
protected for a long time.

1538437660362
367
Mark: Just mold.

1538437660829
1235
Mike: Yeah.

1538437662164
901
Frank: It’s missing some of
the strips and stuff like that.

1538437663165
534
Mark: Well see all
that, I took it all off.

1538437663799
634
Frank: All the strips?

1538437664533
1068
Mark: All this is stainless.

1538437665701
2102
Frank: So you got the
strips to go along the side.

1538437667903
434
Mark: I got everything that...

1538437668437
934
<?> Yeah.

1538437669471
701
Mike: So you took it
off, you were thinking

1538437670272
434
about starting
to work on it.

1538437670806
934
Mark: Yeah right.

1538437671840
767
Mike: I can tell that
Frank is completely

1538437672708
1568
interested in this boat.

1538437674377
4171
The way he’s massaging the
wood, the questions he’s asking.

1538437678648
1401
Frank: I got a friend of
mine, his name is Peter,

1538437680149
1602
he specializes
in wooden boats.

1538437681851
868
Mark: Right.

1538437682819
1335
Frank: If I was to
take a few pictures,

1538437684253
1401
kind of figure out
how much it’s worth,

1538437685755
1902
would you entertain
an offer?

1538437687757
534
Mark: Sure.

1538437688391
868
Go ahead.

1538437689358
801
Frank: Okay.

1538437690259
968
Frank: You know,
these kind of boats,

1538437691327
1168
they’re a little bit
out of my comfort zone.

1538437692595
2169
Mike: Take a
picture of the front, Frank.

1538437694864
868

1538437695831

this carpet off of here.

1538437696332
901
Frank: I gotcha.

1538437697333
1502
Mike: Oh yeah, look at that.

1538437698934
1335
Frank: We have a
friend named Peter Mellon.

1538437700369
3337
He is one of the
largest antique boat brokers.

1538437703806
2870
I’m going to send him some
pictures and hopefully he can

1538437706776
3270
give us some information
before I make an offer.

1538437710146
767
Mike: Mmm...

1538437711013
400
Frank: What are
you seeing, Mike?

1538437711514
968
Oh he’s got...

1538437712582
968
Mike: Old Pepsi machine,
still got the key in it.

1538437713649
1068

1538437714817
1768

got... you guys put

1538437716686
1568
""Beer 25 cents""
on here.

1538437718354
1702
[laughs]
Mark: Right.

1538437720156
1468
Mike: When’s the last
time this baby was fired up?

1538437721724
2636
Mark: Probably 1977.

1538437724460
1235
Mike: No doubt.

1538437725794
1134
Frank: So you put money in it in
it and instead of a can of pop

1538437727029
1268
coming out you get
the Old Milwaukee?

1538437728397
400
Mark: Yeah.

1538437728897
1201
Yeah.

1538437730199
2336
Mike: The last time I was able
to buy an upright Pepsi Cola

1538437732634
3704
machine was in a
junkyard in Atlantic City.

1538437736438
934
Mike: Frank!

1538437737473
1501
Oh he’s holding out on us.

1538437739074
1468
Frank: Barry, you got the
Pepsi machine back here?

1538437740642
1602
Mike: Oh man!

1538437742344
868
Barry: Isn’t that
neat or what?

1538437743312
1235
Frank: That’s a good one.

1538437744646
2803
Mike: 90% of the time, if you’re
going to find an upright early

1538437747550
2603
soda machine, it’s
going to be a Coke machine.

1538437750253
1034
Mike: Would you sell it?

1538437751387
1201
Mark: Yeah I’ll sell it.

1538437752688
1768
Mike: What would you
have to have for it?

1538437754557
1401
Mark: 2,500.

1538437756059
1268
Mike: No kidding!

1538437757427
1768
Mark: It’s what I’d
like to have for it.

1538437759295
934
Mike: Ugh!

1538437760329
1602
Mark: You want to
make me the offer?

1538437762031
2703
Mike: If this cleans up, if the
plastic cleans up in front...

1538437764834
1702
Mark: It should.

1538437766636
2135
Mike: If that
cleans up really well...

1538437768871
1034
I don’t know what
this is on here,

1538437770006
1535
it’s almost like a
waxy residue.

1538437771641
1068
But you can see...

1538437772808
1435
like right there
there’s a big crack in it.

1538437774343
1535
That’s from
everybody going bam!

1538437775978
367
Bam!

1538437776445
534
Bam!

1538437777079
868
Trying to get their...

1538437778047
1401
Mark: Give me
more money back. [laughs]

1538437779549
1668
Mike:
That’s what that’s from.

1538437781317
2569
To be honest with you, I think
that the retail on it’s like,

1538437783986
2769
if it cleans up really nice and
the compressor works and stuff,

1538437786856
3203
I’m thinking it’s like 15-
1,800 bucks at the most.

1538437790159
534
You know
what I mean?

1538437790793
868
I mean, I don’t know.

1538437791761
1702
I’m like...

1538437793563
2202
I’m like 800 bucks.

1538437795865
1535
And that’s if it’s
full of Old Milwaukee.

1538437797499
1768
[laughs]

1538437799368
1435
Mark: I’ll get, I’ll get
you a Milwaukee.

1538437800902
1068
I’ll take 1,000 for it.

1538437802070
868
Mike: 1,000?

1538437803038
1668
Ugh... let me
think about it.

1538437804806
501
1,000 bucks.

1538437805407
1468
Let me...

1538437806976
1201
let me ponder that.

1538437808277
2870
Mike: I offer 800,
he wants $1,000.

1538437811247
1535
I’m kicking it
around a little bit.

1538437812882
1001
This is a pretty
big building,

1538437813983
1468
I want to see what
else is in here.

1538437815551
2402
Mike: Oh my gosh, this is
all one piece, isn’t it!

1538437818053
1101
This thing’s massive.

1538437821790
2536
Where’d you find these?

1538437824426
1702
Mark: My dad had
them at our lake house,

1538437826228
601
up in the attic.

1538437826929
1001
[laughs] Mike: No kidding.

1538437828030
2069
Everybody must have seen
your house on the lake!

1538437830199
2636
Mike: Then I find a
set of island lights.

1538437832935
2369
These were on the gas
station island above the

1538437835404
2936
pumps to illuminate
that area.

1538437838440
2069
Mike: Got those...

1538437840609
2369
Mike: These are large
porcelain shades with some

1538437843079
1535
of the original
mounting hardware.

1538437844714
2469
The pole is gone, but
the arms extending

1538437847283
2302
the shades out
is still there.

1538437849685
1168
Mike: I probably should have
asked you this before

1538437850953
2302
I pulled them out-
would you sell them?

1538437853356
601
Mark: Sure.

1538437854056
934
Mike: Okay good.

1538437855091
1602
<Mike & Mark laughs>

1538437856793
2836
Mike: You’re at $1,000
on the Pepsi machine,

1538437859729
2669
I’m more at like
teetering around 8.

1538437862498
4271
So... 1,600 for all of it.

1538437866869
1735
Mark: Do it.

1538437868704
501
Mike: We’re doing it?

1538437869305
701
Mark: Doing it.

1538437870105
400
Mike: Okay.

1538437870606
968
I appreciate ya.

1538437871673
1969
Mike: Gas and oil guys,
service station guys

1538437873742
1368
would love to
have these.

1538437875210
1235
If you’re building a
service station out,

1538437876545
2169
a man cave, you want
to be authentic...

1538437878814
1602
these would
be perfect.

If you have psoriasis, ...

1538437931533
2402
little things can be a big deal.

1538437933936
1535
That’s why there’s Otezla.

1538437935471
1568
Otezla is not a cream.

1538437937039
1068
It’s a pill
that treats

1538437938107
801
moderate to
severe

1538437938907
1501
plaque psoriasis differently.

1538437940576
767
With Otezla,

1538437941343
1668
75%
clearer skin

1538437943011
868
is achievable.

1538437943879
567
Don’t use if

1538437944546
1368
you’re allergic
to Otezla .

1538437945914
2803
It may cause severe diarrhea,
nausea, or vomiting.

1538437948717
1268
Otezla is
associated with...

1538437949985
1902
...an increased risk
of depression.

1538437951887
1034
Tell your doctor
if you have █

1538437952921
934
a history of depression

1538437953856
1034
or suicidal thoughts,...

1538437954924
1635
...or if these
feelings develop.

1538437956559
1235
Some people taking Otezla

1538437957794
1034
reported weight loss.

1538437958828
1468
Your doctor should
monitor your weight

1538437960296
1235
and may stop treatment.

1538437961531
1668
Upper respiratory
tract infection

bird-dogging a boat,

Frank: Peter.

1538438138307
1001
Peter (on phone):
Yes Frank?

1538438139408
1568
Frank: Hey did you get
the pictures on the boat?

1538438141076

I did indeed.

Peter’s the man.

He knows when they were
made, how many that were made,

1538438196264
2202
manufactured, where,
when, what- everything.

1538438198567
2402
I mean, this guy is a
walking encyclopedia

1538438201069
1568
when it comes to boats.

1538438207242
1468
Mark: It’s a Chrysler flathead.

1538438208810
1101
Frank: Chrysler flathead.

1538438210011
1001
Mark: 6.
Frank: 6.

1538438220389
968
Frank: What it’s
got going for it,

1538438221456
1268
it’s been sitting
inside for awhile.

1538438222824
2603
And it is a 16-footer and it
could be done in like

1538438225527
1001
a garage or
something, right?

1538438246715
1001
Frank: Right.

1538438265300
1001
Frank: Okay.

1538438275244
2436
Frank: When Peter said
$15,000 to restore it,

1538438277780
3437
I mean, that’s 4 times more
than the boat’s even worth now.

1538438281316
2736
That is turning
into a big project.

1538438284153
1101
Frank: Hey Peter,
thanks a lot.

1538438285354
968
You’re the man.

1538438287589
1235
Frank: Alright. Take care.
Mike: Bye-bye.

1538438288924
2536
Frank: Is this something you
would even consider selling?

1538438291560
934
Mark: Uh...

1538438292594
2035
Frank, from what he
was saying, I just...

1538438294730
2236
wouldn’t want to
sell it for that.

1538438297065
2035
It’s more sentimental
value to me and I...

1538438299200
901
Frank: Sure.

1538438300201
1235
Mark: At some point,
I hope I can fix it.

1538438301536
1768
Frank: Mark says he’s
going to get to this project.

1538438303405
1502
They took all the
trim off of it,

1538438305006
3003
they’ve kept it inside, and
Mark’s the kind of guy to do it,

1538438308109
1602
because if he had
to farm it out,

1538438309811
1869
it’d cost more money to
fix it than the whole

1538438311780
1001
thing would
be worth.

1538438312881
868
Mike: He kind of just...

1538438313849
1368
basically described you.

1538438315317
1034
Mark: Right.

1538438316451
1034
Mike: He’s like, ""someone
that remembered the boat,

1538438317586
1468
someone that has that
experience with the boat.""

1538438319154
1068
Frank: Time.

1538438320322
1134
Mike: And so if you do it
yourself and you know what

1538438321556
3537
you’re doing, then you
still got room on the back end.

1538438325193
434
Mark: That’s right.

1538438325727
868
Frank: Sure.

1538438326695
934
Mark: I’m going to
keep the boat and...

1538438327729
1869
I’ll work on it
with my sons.

1538438329698
2369
Mike: You get the van
rolling, get the boat...

1538438332167
367
Mark: Pull it behind that.

1538438332634
334
Frank: Yeah.

1538438333068
968
Oh yeah...

1538438334135
968
Mike: And you could pull
the boat behind the van.

1538438335203
634
Frank: That’d look
great going down the road.

1538438335937
834
Mark: I may make it do a...

1538438336871
1101
a wheelie in the
front when you take off.

1538438338073
1201
Mike: Oh my gosh,
that’d be cool, wouldn’t it?

1538438339375
1768
Mark: I think we can get it
back looking like it did when,

1538438341243
1668
when my dad
bought it.

1538438343012
868
Mike: Alright...

1538438343979
1502
Frank: Careful now.

1538438345581
801
Frank: I didn’t
get to buy the boat,

1538438346482
1034
you know, but at
the end of the day,

1538438347616
1568
we got a few nice
little pieces here.

1538438349284
2936
Mike: You find some
mint Jensen Triaxials...

1538438352320

1538438357292

Mark: Mike and
Frank were very cool.

1538438358126
968
I’d have them

1538438359194

on my wine etiquette-

1538438371039
1602
cabernet, merlot...

1538438372741
1768
Mike: You don’t want to
taste the wine in your mouth.

1538438374609
2803
You want to taste
the wine in your face!

1538438377512
1502
Frank: Want a
bottle of water?

1538438379114
2202
Mike: You want me to describe
the taste of a bottle of water?

1538438381416
1702
Frank: Yeah.

1538438383218
2536
Mike: [making funny
tasting noises]

1538438385854
1268
A little charcoal-y....

1538438389891
1335
Kind of
marshmallow-y...

1538438391326
1735
Frank: There’s no
marshmallow in that water.

1538438393161
1268
Mike: I like the
way that it finishes.

1538438394529
1568
To me it’s
marshmallow-y.

1538438396197
1034
Frank: Not really
seeing that.

1538438397332
2469
Purified water, a
little calcium in there...

(Roger) Being a good father

1538437868629
1969
is important to me so
being diagnosed with advanced

1538437870631
3270
non-small cell lung cancer made
me think of all the things

1538437873934
2035
that I wanted to teach my kids.

1538437876003
2402
(AVO) Another TRU story with
KEYTRUDA.

1538437878438
2002
(Roger) My doctor said I
could start on KEYTRUDA

1538437880474
934
so I did.

1538437881441
2870
With each scan things
just got better.

1538437884344
2669
(AVO) In a clinical study,
KEYTRUDA offered patients

1538437887047
1335
a longer life than chemotherapy.

1538437888415
1835
And it could be your first
treatment.

1538437890284
2402
KEYTRUDA is for adults with
non-small cell lung cancer

1538437892720
968
that has spread...

1538437893721
1535
...who test positive for
PD-L1

1538437895289
3437
and whose tumors do not have an
abnormal ""EGFR"" or ""ALK"" gene.

1538437898759
3270
It’s the immunotherapy with the
most FDA-approved uses for

1538437902062
1902
advanced lung cancer.

1538437903997
1802
KEYTRUDA can cause your immune
system to

1538437905833
2102
attack normal organs and
tissues in your body

1538437907968
2069
and affect how they work. This
can happen anytime

1538437910071
3003
during or after treatment and
may be severe and lead to death.

1538437913107
2102
See your doctor right away if
you experience new or

1538437915242
2436
worsening cough, chest pain,
shortness of breath,

1538437917711
3337
diarrhea, severe stomach pain or
tenderness, nausea or vomiting,

1538437921081
1535
rapid heartbeat, constipation,

1538437922650
2102
changes in urine, changes in
eyesight,

1538437924785
1034
muscle pain or weakness,

1538437925853
2169
joint pain, confusion or memory
problems,

1538437928055
2069
fever, rash, itching or
flushing,

1538437930157
3170
as this may keep these problems
from becoming more serious.

1538437933360
2135
These are not all the possible
side effects of KEYTRUDA.

1538437935529
2503
Tell your doctor about all your
medical conditions

1538437938064
2069
including immune system
problems, or if you’ve had

1538437940167
3837
an organ transplant or lung,
breathing, or liver problems.

1538437944037
2769
(Roger ) Before I’d think of
the stuff I might miss.

1538437946840
1935
But now with
KEYTRUDA, we have hope.

1538437948809
2202
(AVO) Living longer is possible.

1538437951044
1001
It’s TRU.

1538437952078
1268
KEYTRUDA, from Merck.

1538437953446
